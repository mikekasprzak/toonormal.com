<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As mentioned in my earlier posts, I‚Äôm running both SVN and AppDailySales on it (iTunes Connect Sales Stat grabber). In addition, I‚Äôve been running an internal wiki on it. I used to host 2 different external wikis, but both have been imported and archived locally.</p>
<p>I chose DokuWiki for my internal wiki because it uses flat files, meaning I don‚Äôt have to run SQL (though it is just a button to enable MySQL on the Synology). This has the added bonus that I can regularly commit the data to my SVN repository for extra redundancy (the Data and Media folders). On my TODO list is to add an automated task that commits wiki changes every morning, but hey, I decided to write this post instead. üòâ</p>
<p>Here are are some of the more recent developments.</p>
<h2 id="moving-hiccups">Moving Hiccups</h2>
<p>Since I moved in to my new apartment, I‚Äôve actually been having an issue with my NAS. AppDailySales, the python script I use to get my latest sales data, it wasn‚Äôt working. This required me to manually run my script to get sales data, but unfortunately, I‚Äôve lost just shy of 3 weeks of sales data. Seeing how Smiles is a good 3 years old now, I‚Äôm not too bothered by the loss of daily data (weekly is still available), but it‚Äôs still a bit of a disappointment.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure what compelled me, but I decided to investigate the connection problem today. Long story short, my DNS and Gateway settings were set wrong. Looking back, getting my network setup correctly was a real pain, so this doesn‚Äôt surprise me. My DSL modem apparently also acts like a router, so to get the two to play together nicely, I set my real router use a different IP (192.168.1.2 instead of 192.168.1.1). Silly NAS was set to ‚Äú.1‚Äù instead of ‚Äú.2‚Äù.</p>
<p>Part of that network config, I changed IP blocks from 192.168.0.x to 192.168.1.x, since that‚Äôs what my new router used. I had previously set static IP addresses for the NAS (.110), so I had to re-run the windows DSAssistant tool to change the IP block (an IP in 192.168.0.x cannot see an IP in 192.168.1.x, at least not with a subnet of 255.255.255.0).</p>
<p>Those were the only 2 issues introduced during my move. That‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt find more ways to mess things up. üòÄ</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-from-dsm-31-to-32">Upgrading from DSM 3.1 to 3.2</h2>
<p>About a month ago, Synology finally released the latest version of the OS for their devices. And not even a week ago, they released a bugfix for that. The changelog is extensive, including some improvements to features I‚Äôd like to start using, so today seemed a good day to update.</p>
<p>Updating was extremely easy. Since I started with 3.1, all I had to do was click the update button in the Control Panel. After it downloaded, just clicked install. Waited, and it was finished. Very nice.</p>
<p>But as expected, a few settings got messed up after updating. Nothing built in to the UI, but my cron job for running AppDailySales got removed from the /etc/crontab file. No problem, <a href="/2011/08/23/appdailysales-and-running-on-synology-nas-devices/">I wrote down what I did here in a blog post</a>. THAT is why I‚Äôm writing this here now.</p>
<p>SVN seems to be still running properly. Nothing to do there. All my settings are still set. The wiki is still running. Great.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>EVIL</strong> Thumbnail generation processes are back! These eat up 100% of the CPU usage, doing pointless thumbnail generation. Ack!</p>
<p>But <a href="/2011/08/23/i-am-running-a-synology-nas-now/">like before</a>, this is easily fixed.</p>
<p><code>cd /usr/syno/etc/rc.d/&lt;br /&gt; S77synomkthumbd.sh stop&lt;br /&gt; S88synomkflvd.sh stop</code></p>
<p>But unlike my old notes, I have since found that renaming the files was not enough. The better solution is to move them out of the <strong>rc.d</strong> folder.</p>
<p><code>mkdir ../rc.d.I_REALLY_HATE_THUMBNAILS&lt;br /&gt; mv S77synomkthumbd.sh ../rc.d.I_REALLY_HATE_THUMBNAILS&lt;br /&gt; mv S88synomkflvd.sh ../rc.d.I_REALLY_HATE_THUMBNAILS</code></p>
<p>After waiting a while double checking ‚Äútop‚Äù, I then saw a process <strong>fileindexd</strong> start up and eat my CPU. no problem.</p>
<p><code>S66fileindexd.sh stop</code></p>
<p>This one I did not remove from the folder, so it‚Äôll certainly start up again once the NAS reboots. Thumbnails are useless to me, but file indexes I need to look in to. I don‚Äôt yet know if these file indexes are a Synology thing or a Linux thing.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve had to fix since upgrading.</p>
<p>Now, lets try out some new features!</p>
<h2 id="remote-backups">Remote Backups</h2>
<p>At long last, I finally set up remote backups on the device. I‚Äôm actually backing up my data 2 places:</p>
<ol>
<li>To the ‚Äúother‚Äù NAS</li>
<li>To Amazon S3</li>
</ol>
<p>Both options are built-in to the device, you simply have to provide login credentials‚Ä¶ oh, and one thing each.</p>
<ul>
<li>On your ‚Äúother‚Äù Synology NAS, you need to enable Network Backup mode (in the control panel).</li>
<li>On Amazon S3, you need to create a bucket to store the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm especially fond of the Amazon option, not only because it‚Äôs remote, but because it lets me experiment with Amazon AWS services. Amazon gives you a whole bunch of free data and services for 12 months, and if my math is correct, once those 12 months expire it‚Äôll cost me less than $0.50 a month to host my 3 GB repository mirror. Not bad‚Ä¶ Heck, that‚Äôs a bargain given what that data is worth to me (my whole biz relies on this).</p>
<p>Best I can tell, it only stores a single copy of each file on the backup destination (as it should), and only sends files that have changed. There is an optional addon extension called ‚ÄúTime Backup‚Äù, which as far as I can tell works just like Apple‚Äôs Time Machine. Time Backup only works with remote Synology devices, or attached external drives (no Amazon).</p>
<h2 id="vpn">VPN</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So today I set up a VPN. This is an addon feature for the Synology that‚Äôs pretty great. I wont bother describing the setup, since it‚Äôs literally a checkbox and some minor configuration. I‚Äôm using PPTP, since it seems to be supported everywhere. It‚Äôs literally a feature of Windows, OSX, iOS, Android, and I would not be surprised if it worked on stock Ubuntu too (I have not checked as of this writing).</p>
<p>The only real work was opening the port on my router, and calling that work is pretty silly. After opening the port, I was able to access the VPN locally by using my IP. That wasn‚Äôt enough of a test for for me though, so I picked up my laptop and visited my parents to ‚Äúborrow‚Äù their WIFI. Yep, worked great. Once connected, I can commit and checkout from my SVN repository, view my wiki, and even access devices on my network‚Ä¶ all from far far away.</p>
<p>I figure I‚Äôll only be using this when I‚Äôm out of town, or hanging/jamming at a friends place. Still, it perfectly solves my SVN problems, and gives me a bunch of nice features. My router easily lets me turn this off too, so I can keep my local network nice and secure in the off season.</p>
<h2 id="summary-ology">Summary-ology</h2>
<p>The Synology DS211j NAS ‚Äì Easily the best $200 (+drives) I‚Äôve spent in a long time.</p>
