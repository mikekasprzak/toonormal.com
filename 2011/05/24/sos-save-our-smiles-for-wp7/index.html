<p>I made this game (<strong>Smiles</strong>), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:</p>

<p>It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?</p>
<p>Prior to launch, I participated in a Windows Phone 7 press event in Toronto, amongst other things.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2010/10/2860.05_5F00_826245f5_2D00_d969_2D00_4fc4_2D00_b39d_2D00_9700d9143204.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Geez Mike, you&rsquo;re blurry and wearing shorts to a press event&hellip; <em>sigh</em></p>
<p>The WP7 version hasn&rsquo;t done very well.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2011/05/WP7Sales.png" alt=""></p>
<p>10 Sales, 14 Trials. Trials I only enabled recently, which is why they&rsquo;re so low.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2011/05/WP7Graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, at least the graph looks cool&hellip; I guess</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want much:</p>
<p>All I want is to cover the annual platform cost ($99).</p>
<p>At <strong>$2.99</strong> (70% of is $2.09), that&rsquo;s about 50 sales total&hellip; but to make matters worse, I think I have to earn $250 before I will get a single payout (feel free to correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong). That and my bank charges something stupid like $40 to receive a payment these days (gee thanks CIBC), but $250 should cover all that.</p>
<p>A few months back, I thought I&rsquo;d try something. Inside the control panel, there&rsquo;s a checkbox that says whether a game has a trial version or not. We never added code to handle the trial, but I decided to click that checkbox anyways. Ahem, let me rephrase this&hellip;</p>
<p>The trial of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smiles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for WP7 is the full game!</p>
<p>So great! Visit the Zune store right now, and go get yourself a <strong>free full game</strong>. And if you like it, please buy it. If I can&rsquo;t earn enough for a payout, <strong>I wont be renewing and it will automatically remove the game from the Zune store</strong>.</p>
<p>If your PC is set up correctly, you can click here:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;#038;id=ab1dce4c-b3d5-df11-a844-00237de2db9e&amp;#038;source=TooNormal">http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;#038;id=ab1dce4c-b3d5-df11-a844-00237de2db9e&amp;#038;source=TooNormal</a></p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2011/05/TileIcon173.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/icons/wp7banner.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Otherwise, search for <strong>Smiles</strong>.</p>
<p>My total investment in the WP7 version of the game was about $3000. Being realistic, I don&rsquo;t expect to recoup those costs. Still, if can at least earn the $250 necessary for a payout, then I wont have to remove it. I think it&rsquo;s fair to expect a platform to be capable of covering its own annual costs, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>So tell your friends, everyone with a WP7 phone! Come get a free game, and if you like it, buy it and support me for just a few bucks. Thanks!</p>
<p>PS: The game is also available for several other phones and devices:</p>
