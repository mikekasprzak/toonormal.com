  <div class="post-content"><p>Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my “Microsoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account” yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.</p>
<p>I made this game (<strong>Smiles</strong>), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?</p>
<p>Prior to launch, I participated in a Windows Phone 7 press event in Toronto, amongst other things.</p>

<p>The WP7 version hasn’t done very well.</p>

<p>I don’t want much:</p>
<p>All I want is to cover the annual platform cost ($99).</p>
<p>At <strong>$2.99</strong> (70% of is $2.09), that’s about 50 sales total… but to make matters worse, I think I have to earn $250 before I will get a single payout (feel free to correct me if I’m wrong). That and my bank charges something stupid like $40 to receive a payment these days (gee thanks CIBC), but $250 should cover all that.</p>
<p>A few months back, I thought I’d try something. Inside the control panel, there’s a checkbox that says whether a game has a trial version or not. We never added code to handle the trial, but I decided to click that checkbox anyways. Ahem, let me rephrase this…</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So great! Visit the Zune store right now, and go get yourself a <strong>free full game</strong>. And if you like it, please buy it. If I can’t earn enough for a payout, <strong>I wont be renewing and it will automatically remove the game from the Zune store</strong>.</p>
<p>If your PC is set up correctly, you can click here:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Otherwise, search for <strong>Smiles</strong>.</p>
<p>My total investment in the WP7 version of the game was about $3000. Being realistic, I don’t expect to recoup those costs. Still, if can at least earn the $250 necessary for a payout, then I wont have to remove it. I think it’s fair to expect a platform to be capable of covering its own annual costs, don’t you?</p>
<p>So tell your friends, everyone with a WP7 phone! Come get a free game, and if you like it, buy it and support me for just a few bucks. Thanks!</p>
<p>PS: The game is also available for several other phones and devices:</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>
