  <div class="post-content"><p>Wow. To say the last 3 weeks have been busy would be an understatement.</p>
<p>First of all, I ported <strong>Smiles</strong> to a new phone. The <strong>Samsung Omnia II</strong>, a Windows Mobile phone with a beautiful amoled screen and a custom GPU. Some photos.</p>

<p>Itz-a me! Zen in Italiano!</p>
<p>For those keeping score, the game unfortunately runs a little slow on the Omnia II. It&rsquo;s definitely playable, but the GPU is no PowerVR SGX. I did what I could in the time I had, optimized my shaders and all that, but it&rsquo;s what it is. I&rsquo;ll post some videos later once I have more platforms to compare.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back to this.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/assets/uploads/2009/08/LD2009-Highres-300x39.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next is Ludum Dare 16, which was this past weekend. Amazingly, we got <strong><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview">121 entries</a></strong> this time, and it&rsquo;s December!? Historically, December is always our slowest compo, but 121 is just 2 less than April.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t really know what happened, but 2009 has been an <em>incredible</em> year for Ludum Dare. In August of 2008 we ended the silly ‚Äúconstantly moving‚Äù game we&rsquo;ve played over the years, and returned to LudumDare.com. Our entries for that and the next were average (I think 60-70 each, I&rsquo;ll have to do some digging to get all the numbers). But 2009 hit and we&rsquo;ve been setting records ever since.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to find some time before the new year to write up a proper retrospective of 2009. Voting ends January 3rd, so it&rsquo;d be a fitting thing to have for then. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>But the crunch has only just begun.</p>
<p>Next on my agenda is to finish-up the Italian build of Smiles Drop. Yes, in case you didn&rsquo;t notice, the Zen shot above is in Italian (but please ignore the word UNDO, k-thx-bye!). The Samsung ports I did for a contest held by Samsung. They wanted builds in both English and Italian, and I was able to deliver 3 of 4 (Zen and Drop standalone, no bundle). The Zen Italian build I finished and submitted 10 minutes before the deadline. If I had 2 more hours, I could have finished Drop too. Ah well. All that&rsquo;s left is to fix is a couple lines of text that are too long, and to package it up.</p>
<p>After that, the crunch continues. I&rsquo;d like to finish a Netbook version of Smiles by the 20th, or at least power through this features todo list I have in front of me. That&rsquo;s the plan anyways.</p>
<p>After that, I guess I can take a few days off. üòâ</p>
<p>So fun fun. Back to the grind.</p>
