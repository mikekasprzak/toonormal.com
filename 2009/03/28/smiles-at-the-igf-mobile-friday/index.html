  <div class="post-content"><p>Friday was the short day. Wednesday and Thursday we exhibited 10-6, where Friday was 10-3. Went back to the hotel and vegged that day, before heading back out to hang with the Fantastic Contraption guys.</p>
<p>My neighbors were the Secret Exit guys. I ended up spending a bulk of the show goofing off with Tuukka, an artist on Zen Bound. The Secret Exit guys refer to him as the ‚Äúprankster‚Äù of the bunch. I stepped out on occasion, one time to see a talk (Experimental Games Workshop). When I got back, my sign changed.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2009/03/modifiedsign.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>I had a great time at the show. I&rsquo;m kicking myself for not taking any video, but there weren&rsquo;t many opportunities it seemed practical. Something else I should have done was put a little red Canadian maple leaf icon/sticker on my kiosk. The reason, I ended up watching as CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company) interviewed my award winning neighbors (Secret Exit) for Canadian TV, and completely ignore me&hellip; the only Canadian in the IGF Mobile too. üòâ</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for now. Sitting in a hotel lobby blogging. Plane leaves at midnight, and it&rsquo;s back to Canada. Ta ta.</p>
