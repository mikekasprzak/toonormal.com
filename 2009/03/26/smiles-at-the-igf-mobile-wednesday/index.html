I’m sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale.">

<p>I’m sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale. Me, I needed an “I’m not here” sign, so here’s what I came up with given the tools I had.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/igfsign.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>For the most part you didn’t see this, since I stuck around all day. Still, I was ready in case I had to step out. Left the sign and some cards when I finished for the night.</p>
<p>Dead tired, but I’ll be there again tomorrow. Hopefully, I can secure a chair for the day.</p>
