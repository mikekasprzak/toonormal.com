<p>Just a few hours ago I could barely move. Nearly <em>crawling</em> my way out of bed to attack the day (ahem&hellip; night), after the long flight home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve since returned to my regular routine of pacing around my studio (i.e. basement), between moments of awe e-mailing and ranting everywhere it seems appropriate (forums, twitter). As I exhausted all those wonderful forms of communication, it seemed to be right time to start the required retrospective post.</p>
<p>To say I had a great time would be an understatement. Had I been around for just the usual routine of random game industry talks, I could see myself having just a ‚Äúgood‚Äù time. But being part of the IGF Mobile, attending the Independent Games Summit, IGF+GD Choice Awards, and the numerous other events and gatherings I was invited to put it over the top. Putting a face to the name/avatar of dozens of people I know from the Internets, hanging out with fellow developers, and catching up with friends and former coworkers was a blast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to be a part of this great community.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2009/03/smilesigflogo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At the <a href="http://gdc.gamespot.com/video/6206799/">IGF+GD Choice Awards</a>, Petri Purho of <a href="http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/">Kloonigames</a> and <a href="http://www.crayonphysics.com/">Crayon Physics</a> fame had this to say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Winning the IGF is something that can generally change the course of a persons life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say though, <em>not</em> winning the IGF can be pretty great too. üòâ</p>
<p>iPhone is a tough market. There&rsquo;s pretty much <a href="http://www.streamingcolour.com/blog/2009/03/09/the-numbers-post-aka-brutal-honesty/">no disputing that</a>. I&rsquo;m not planning to fully disclose my sales numbers, but I figured I&rsquo;d share some details to celebrate the occasion.</p>
<p>The day before my IGF nomination (late January), I hit my all time low of 1 sale. I&rsquo;ve never sold zero copies, but obviously I was close. This was before my ‚Äúlite‚Äù version. All I had pushing the game was the original $4.99 version, in addition to a pair of $2.99 versions of standalone Zen and Drop.</p>
<p>So the IGF nomination hits, blam, sales are back from the dead. Nothing big enough to put me on the charts, but it got people talking again.</p>
<p>A few days later, ‚Äúlite‚Äù version <strong>Free Smiles</strong> hits the store. It didn&rsquo;t have too much immediate impact, but I&rsquo;d attribute most of my sales thereafter to the lite version.</p>
<p>Then comes the Game Developers Conference. After a great day of IGS festivities, hanging out with <a href="http://www.casuallyhardcore.com/">Nelson</a> and a couple <a href="http://www.tojam.ca">ToJam</a> guys, back at the hotel <a href="http://www.galcon.com">Phil</a> and I make a wonderful discovery.</p>

<p>Where does that lovely image go you ask?</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2009/03/igfapple.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Heck yeah! So officially, <strong>Smiles</strong> has <em>now</em> been featured by Apple. Not individually yet, but as part of a collection of titles of some significance. Woo hoo!</p>
<p>Day 1 of that was <em>by far</em> the most sales I&rsquo;ve ever made in a single day. Those numbers slowed quickly, but were still very good. Over the next few days, I finally broke on to Strategy and Family charts for the first time. I&rsquo;m not sure if being on these charts has helped the momentum, but I quite enjoy seeing myself listed. As of right now, <strong>Smiles</strong> is <strong>#42</strong> Strategy and <strong>#29</strong> Family in the US. In my home country of <strong>Canada</strong>, well, I could use more love there. üòâ</p>
<p>If you looked at the image above, you might have noticed a sale price. Yep, to end the night Friday, I put <strong>Smiles</strong> on sale. <strong>$2.99</strong> for the full game, or <strong>$1.99</strong> each. That resulted in a boost in sales, roughly following a similar curve to Apple&rsquo;s initial IGF page results. Day 1 of the sale broke my prior ‚Äú<em>sales in a single day</em>‚Äù record (though I earned less from it).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my brief look at GDC and being featured for the first time. I&rsquo;m going to leave the <strong>$2.99</strong> sale up for at least today (Monday), and update the icon (even though you&rsquo;ll only see it in iTunes and not the App Store).</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone that made my visit to GDC incredibly memorable, the judges for choosing my game out of the 100+ entries, and the IGF and GDC organizers that gave me this great opportunity to show more people my game.</p>
