<p>Also now, the “support the developer!” starburst takes the place of the music instructions. It works just like clicking on the Smiles icon does (brings up a popup confirming that you want to open the store). And for fun, all the popups play the “Woo Hoo!” sound like the Zen and Drop cross promotion does. For the free version only, I’ll be making clicking “no” play the “Aww!” sound, as there’s really no other place to fit that in.</p>
<p>My hope is to be finished integrating the 1.3 updates and testing by noon Sunday (i.e. today). I’ve actually been up since 1:30 AM, which is one of the perks of being self employed (your hours don’t have to make sense).</p>
<p>Monday I’m hoping to be back on the PC version of Smiles. I’d like a release candidate finished before the end of the month, so I can iron out the distribution plans.</p>
<p>EDIT: Free Smiles 1.3 sent to Apple. That’s all of them.</p>
