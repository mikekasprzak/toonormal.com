  <div class="post-content"><p>Or in other words, awesome C an C++ language features you‚Äôll learn to love in GCC, that‚Äôll break your heart if you ever have to use Visual Studio. üòâ</p>
<p>This is a list I collected whilst getting my Smiles PC code to compile with Visual Studio 2008. Most have no equivalent in Visual Studio, but one simply has a slightly different syntax (compatible too).</p>
<p>As before, long and technical. Hit the link if you‚Äôre up for the challenge. You‚Äôve been warned. üòÄ</p>
<h2 id="determining-if-it8217s-visual-studio">Determining if it‚Äôs Visual Studio</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, you can check for the symbol <strong>_MSC_VER</strong>. If it exists it‚Äôs Visual Studio, otherwise it‚Äôs <em>probably</em> GCC. From what I‚Äôve seen, all the non GCC‚Äôs are pretty good at identifying themselves (__MWERKS__, __ARMCC_VERSION, etc).</p>
<h2 id="variadic-macros">Variadic Macros</h2>
<p>In GCC, you can wrap printf and similar functions as follows.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Visual Studio 2008 has a slightly different syntax. To Visual Studio‚Äôs credit, this is part of the C99 standard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Recent versions of GCC support the __VA_ARGS\__ syntax as well. My guess is it‚Äôs the 2.9.x and earlier series that doesn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôve not looked in to it.</p>
<p>An alternate usage can be used to make ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù and __VA_ARGS\__ work as zero arguments.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ## syntax can be used with GCC‚Äôs ‚Äúargs‚Ä¶‚Äù variation too.</p>
<h2 id="case-ranges-in-switch-statements">Case ranges in switch statements</h2>
<p>Once you‚Äôve tried it, you wont want to go back. On GCC you can define a range as follows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My ‚Äúsolution‚Äù has been to create a macro for when you know how many there are.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And yes, there‚Äôs a lot of those. The number in the name says how many to make. This is hardly a perfect solution, as range ambiguity makes the code easier to write.</p>
<h2 id="array-initializers-in-constructors">Array Initializers in Constructors</h2>
<p>If a class contained an array of something, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to be able to initialize it? GCC thinks so.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(Lets ignore intrinsics being better for a moment, okay?)</p>
<p>Visual Studio, not so much. The alternative is <strong>not</strong> to use an initializer list.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The problem with this is if type of the array has a constructor, then it‚Äôs going to call the default constructor for the initializer list stage, then the copy constructor for the assignments above. Theoretically, this example should be an easy optimization to catch (2 assignments without an access in between), so you can always hope the optimizer catches it. But it shouldn‚Äôt be much work to create a case it wont.</p>
<h2 id="variable-and-zero-sized-arrays">Variable and zero sized arrays</h2>
<p>This feature of GCC I love.</p>
<p>Allocating memory off the stack is extremely fast, and almost guaranteed to be consistent. After all, it‚Äôs implemented by a mere change of the stack pointer register. Using local variables is the normal way to do this. With this GCC extension, you can use variables or math to dynamically allocate off the stack. It can be scoped too, to control when the memory is allocated.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Visual Studio can&rsquo;t do that. I need to waste my time allocating off the heap, and cleaning up when I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This can be especially terrible for small blocks of code that, during normal use, only use a handfull of bytes. 2-3 floats worth, or such.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>For the most part, those were the changes I had to make to the code for it to run. There were a couple #pragmas I needed to add too, to shut up some 1200 warnings I was triggering.</p>
<p>There were only a few outright code changes required. The first was flipping my slashes, &ldquo;/&rdquo; to &ldquo;&quot;, as expected of the Windows world. In addition, my directory searching code had to be rewritten. It&rsquo;s noticeably slower than my MinGW equivalent, so there may be something I can do to improve that. Finally, I had to upgrade LZMA, since I guess the version I was using had issues with Visual Studio 2008.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, Smiles built in Visual Studio 2008.</p>

<p>And now that additional compiler compatibility hurdle is behind me. üòâ</p></div>
