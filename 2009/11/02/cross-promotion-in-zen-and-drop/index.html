  <div class="post-content"><p>Smiles 1.3 is already in the Apple queue, but not Zen and Drop yet. Something “new” in 1.3 is that I removed the “how to play music” instructions from the game. This used to be in the upper right corner of the screen. The description used to say you could “double tap” the home button to bring up music playback, but it seems that was wrong on the iPhones and 3rd gen iPods. So rather than have to keep keeping this up to date, it’s gone.</p>
<p>Now this past weekend I did a promotion, giving Smiles Zen away for FREE. What might not be obvious to these nearly 8000 people is that there’s another game, Smiles Drop they may like (like even more perhaps). So instead of simply removing the instructions from the standalone Zen and Drop, I’ve changed them to teaser icons for the opposite game.</p>
<p>Some screenshots of the iPhone build running on my PC.</p>

<p>The description pages I haven’t finished yet. Those come soon.</p>
<p>Something I was considering was implementing actual demos inside that icon. It’s doable, but the problem is how disconnected the 4 builds are. Smiles, Free Smiles, Smiles Zen, and Smiles Drop all separate SVN branches from the Smiles mainline. Even the PC version is a separate branch, so it’s a little disorganized there. So it’s unlikely, but it would be nice.</p>
