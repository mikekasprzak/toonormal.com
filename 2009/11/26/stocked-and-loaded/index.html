  <div class="post-content"><p>An intense month of work awaits. Crunch time, and then some!</p>
<p>Early/Mid last week, I spec‚Äôd out <em>the plan</em> for my time between now and GDC. Quite a busy schedule, with a lot of really cool things coming up. Smiles stuff, and a quick collaboration with a friend, which I‚Äôll talk more about later. I should have plenty to talk about with my internet colleagues in March.</p>
<p>But the icing on the cake was a <em>development</em> Wednesday/Thursday of last week. I‚Äôm going to be a little vague right now, but what I will say is I am porting Smiles to a new phone, and have been for the past week. Between this and that, I have a whole bunch of little things going on too. My brother‚Äôs wedding tomorrow, a little Apple event I‚Äôm attending next week in Toronto, getting Ludum Dare 16 started on time, and deadlines galore. So wow.</p>
<p>But what this post is about is a little ritual of mine. Fridge stocking.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, I do normally have a nice variety of drinks in my fridge, caffeinated and whatnot. But it‚Äôs only special occasions where I go the extra mile and pack it this full. Not seen is the bottom left crisper filled with Jones Cola, and a couple packs of Monster.</p>
<p>The freezer is replenished with a fresh stock of frozen dinners, cereal in the cupboard, and last but not least, noodles!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Numerous varieties of quick junk meals and drinks. And I can guarantee you, there <strong>will</strong> be pizza. üòÄ</p>
<p>Oh yes!</p>
<p>So that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on with me right now. Powering through code, caffeinated drinks, and ramen noodles.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd hope to talk a little more about the design process as it happened, and I may still do that. But I know for the next couple weeks it‚Äôll be nose to the grindstone.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
