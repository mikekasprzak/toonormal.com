  <div class="post-content"><p>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of <strong>Smiles</strong>, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.</p>
<p>To start, I‚Äôm going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my <a href="/2008/03/01/engines-names-and-evolution-part-1/"><strong>Engines</strong></a>, <a href="/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-2/"><strong>Names</strong></a> <strong>and</strong> <a href="/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-3/"><strong>Evolution</strong></a> blog series last year.</p>
<p>I apologize, but I <em>am</em> going to skip a significant follow up to that series for now (the <strong>Hammer</strong> engine), but this series should bring us back up to date.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>Late 2007 and early 2008 were spent working on libraries, and foundation for my new engine <strong>Playground</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Playground</strong> was the successor to <strong>Hammer</strong> (<strong>PuffBOMB HD</strong>‚Ä¶ will talk about this another day), which in turn succeeded <a href="/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-3/"><strong>Freedom</strong></a>.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>Before <strong>PuffBOMB HD</strong> was shelved in late 2007 (<strong>Hammer</strong> engine), I was working alone on the project. Amicably, but that‚Äôs a series for another day.</p>
<p>The core issue with <strong>Hammer</strong> is that it wasn‚Äôt very reusable. As a whole, you could certainly build a new project based on it, but it‚Äôs elements were poorly isolated. Triangulation and collision testing code was embedded right in to the physics engine, so I couldn‚Äôt use the same code elsewhere without a lot of waste.</p>
<p>I prototype games regularly, and the product of this year of development (2007) wasn‚Äôt as useful as it could be.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>Late 2007, I was at a crossroads. I still had savings left, but only enough to support myself. I needed a break from <strong>PuffBOMB HD</strong>, so I coined a new project. A suite of libraries and tools I could personally use for prototyping and developing games faster and more efficiently. The end goal may have been to build a Metroidvania derivative, but the core of the project was to build me some tools. If the project was going to fail again, at least I‚Äôd have a foundation to try the next thing. This was the <strong>Playground</strong> project.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs where I get technical.</p>
<p>As mentioned, <strong>Playground</strong> is a suite of libraries and tools. It started with me collecting what usable parts I could extract from <strong>Hammer</strong>, and my Ludum Dare games and framework.</p>
<p>I should also mention that by library I‚Äôm referring to an element. A directory of files. Either copy the directory in to a project, or set up an SVN External for it. Only a crazy person would compile their work in progress library to a .lib/.a file and install it. If that‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre crazy! üôÇ</p>
<p>One of the first and most useful elements I built was the <em>Data and Serialization</em> library. I decided to finally stop using C++ streams for binary File I/O, but wanted my file reading syntax to be nicer than fopen. The syntax for loading an arbitrary binary file from disk is as follows.</p>
<p><strong>DataBlock</strong>* MyData **=** _new_DataBlock_( ‚ÄúData.bin‚Äù );</p>
<p>Nice and easy. A <strong>DataBlock</strong> is an incredibly useful and lightweight basic type. It represents an arbitrary block of memory with a size stored in the first 4 bytes. It‚Äôs defined as followed.</p>
<p><code>&lt;strong&gt;struct&lt;/strong&gt; DataBlock {&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;size_t&lt;/strong&gt; Size;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;char&lt;/strong&gt; Data[0];&lt;br /&gt; };</code></p>
<p>Pretty simple. For completion, the <em>Data and Serialization</em> library includes similar calls for normal non <strong>DataBlock</strong> data, but they‚Äôre so lightweight and flexible I use them anyways.</p>
<p>The great part about writing your own I/O wrapper is you can seamlessly integrate things like compression, munging, CRC‚Äôs and checksums. For example, load and decompress a file in 3 lines (one cleanup).</p>
<p><strong>DataBlock</strong>* Compressed **=** _new_DataBlock_( ‚ÄúCompressedFile.zlib‚Äù );</p>
<p><strong>DataBlock</strong>* Uncompressed **=** _unpack_ZLIB_DataBlock_( Compressed );</p>
<p><em>delete_DataBlock</em>( Compressed );</p>
<p>The library is also written in such a way that, while it supports many compressors/hash methods, they are not required to be built or linked against the project unless explicitly used. In other words, if I don‚Äôt use BZIP2, I don‚Äôt need the BZIP2 headers or C files. As lightweight as you can make a library.</p>
<p>The <em>vector math</em> library is borrowed right from <strong>Hammer</strong>, cleaned up and isolated to be vector, scalar, and matrix math only. Types for rectangles and simple primitives are a library. Coding niceties like template types containing a,b,c or r,g,b,a components are a library. Strings, parsing a whitespace delimited file, and debug console logging as well.</p>
<p>Collision tests, and everything you do between primitives is a library of functions. Extremely long names, but they‚Äôre now modular in such a way they can be used in a physics engine, in a primitives library or a GUI/Menu system.</p>
<p><code>&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; ( Test_Point_Vs_Polygon2D( ... ) ) ...</code></p>
<p>Where this one returns a boolean value. I wont bother listing the arguments, but it‚Äôs a global C-like function. It takes direct types and pointers where appropriate. The functions follow the form ‚ÄúAction_What_Relationship_Who( ‚Ä¶ );‚Äù. <em>Action</em> is the operation, <em>What</em> and <em>Who</em> are the terms being tested, and the <em>Relationship</em> is the rest of grammar required to describe the operation.</p>
<p><code>Nearest_Point_On_Chain2D( ... );&lt;br /&gt; Nearest_CornerPoint_OnEdgeOf_Polygon3D( ... );</code></p>
<p>Where the <strong>Smiles</strong> story begins is the <strong>Grid</strong> library.</p>
<p><strong>Grid</strong> was a library created for a Ludum Dare game <strong>Pillar Caterpillar</strong>.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs some concept art.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Pillar Caterpillar</strong> wasn‚Äôt playable within the compo timeline. It however still featured some great pre-production work, and a useful chunk of code that became it‚Äôs own library in <strong>Playground</strong>. Further work was done on the project, but that mock-up is the coolest looking part.</p>
<p>For the time being, only minor changes were done to <strong>Grid</strong>.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>Shortly after the iPhone SDK was official announced in March 2008, I started prototyping some game concepts. The first, <strong>Magtraction</strong> (since Magnetica was taken, by a game completely unrelated to magnets).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A prototyped game concept deemed ‚Äú<strong>too boring</strong>‚Äú.</p>
<p>The second, <strong>Dungeon Legion</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A prototype game concept deemed ‚Äú<strong>too awesome</strong>‚Äú. Too awesome to finish in a short period of time. üòÄ</p>
<p>Both of these prototypes were the projects used to get the geometry tests up and working again.</p>
<p>You might hear more about <strong>Pillar Caterpillar</strong> and/or <strong>Dungeon Legion</strong> in the coming months (both projects are on my list I‚Äôm considering).</p>
<p>For the 3rd prototype, I wanted to revisit <strong>Grid</strong>.</p>
