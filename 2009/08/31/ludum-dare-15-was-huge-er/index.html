On the plus side, Phil and I came together and awesome-ified the website. He wrote our all new voting and submission system, and I made the site look new and purty. And when all was said and done, it actually worked! Wow!
It came together the weekend before the competition.">

<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Ludum Dare #14‚Äôs 123 entries in April was a pretty big deal, but our 15th Ludum Dare in August did a whopping <strong>144</strong>! Yikes!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview">http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview</a></p>
<p>On the plus side, <a href="http://www.galcon.com">Phil</a> and I came together and awesome-ified the website. He wrote our <em>all new</em> voting and submission system, and I made the site look new and <em>purty</em>. And when all was said and done, it actually worked! Wow!</p>
<p>It came together the weekend before the competition. I was finishing up my new <a href="http://www.smiles-game.com">Smiles</a> trailer (see a few posts ago), <a href="http://www.galcon.com">Phil</a> doing some Galcon stuff (probably‚Ä¶ heh‚Ä¶ I forget exactly), and one thing lead to another then blamo! An all new Ludum Dare.</p>
<p>Thursday was the game changer. We‚Äôd gone ahead and fixed the old submission system over the weekend, and got half talking about how we‚Äôd do a proper system. Then Phil was hit with some <em>maniacal</em> inspiration. He wanted to take a stab at building the new compo system, and threw down some further demands for co-organizer <a href="http://www.hamumu.com">Mike</a> and myself. So <em>not only</em> did we get the submission system we‚Äôve wanted for years now, but updates to our long out-of-date rules and FAQ, some additional stuff to improve the credibility of the website (logo page, an update to the about page), but <strong>a freaking keynote</strong> too!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2009/08/28/welcome-to-ludum-dare-15/">http://www.ludumdare.com/‚Ä¶/welcome-to-ludum-dare-15/</a></p>
<p>The keynote was an idea I snuck on to our wishlist sometime around Ludum Dare 14. <a href="http://www.hamumu.com">Mike</a> and I have been dabbling with video over the past year, and Mike had been producing <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2009/08/28/welcome-to-ludum-dare-15/">an entertaining video blog</a>. So we put 2 and 2 together, and Mike headlined our opening ceremonies (we have those now?) with this great 3 minute keynote video of his.</p>
<p>So wow! And now we stand, the 48 hours have ended, and voting has now begun. In 2 weeks time, we‚Äôll crown some winning games.</p>
<p>If that, along with Phil and my escapades at GDC in San Fransisco wasn‚Äôt enough, we got some fantastic news earlier in the week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com">Joseph White</a>, a long time Ludum Dare veteran got his latest game a slot in the <strong>Sense of Wonder Night</strong> at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show. Swarm Racer 3000, a great looking game based on his awesome Ludum Dare entry Swarm Racer. And of course with me in media mode, how could I not acknowledge him with a front page news post.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2009/08/26/swarm-racer-3000-at-tokyo-game-show/">http://www.ludumdare.com/‚Ä¶/swarm-racer-3000-at-tgs/</a></p>
<p>So wow. That‚Äôs Ludum Dare ‚Äòeh? üòÄ</p>
<p>So what‚Äôs next? At the very least, we‚Äôre gonna let the voting finish on this current compo. We‚Äôll be holding the next big one, Ludum Dare 16, some time in December. We want to bring the rules a little more up to date, and do anything we can do to help foster this growth trend we‚Äôre seeing. We feel an odd sense of responsibility, now more than ever, to be sure it continues to grow. And well, there‚Äôs a pretty good chance (like 102%) you‚Äôll be seeing me at GDC again. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll be representing, but hey I‚Äôll be there, and hoping to see more Ludum Dare veterans showing their stuff in the IGF and beyond.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to your regularly scheduled ‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ me ignoring my blog? Naw, I wanna start talking about stuff again. I‚Äôll find a way. üôÇ</p>
<p>PS: I edited this post, and <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MikeKasprzak/20090831/2894/Ludum_Dare_15_Was_Hugeer.php">snuck it on to Gamasutra blogs</a> Monday morning. Lo and behold, somebody awesome decided to give it the ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù sticker, and it got to show up briefly on the front page of <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com">Gamasutra.com</a>. Cool!</p>
