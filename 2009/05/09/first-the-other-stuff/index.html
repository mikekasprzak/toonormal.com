  <div class="post-content"><p>Crawling out of bed early this morning, I made the weird decision that it’d be a blogging morning. It seems I’ve stockpiled a few interesting things to talk about. I’m nearly ready to start talking about the new project too, but as the title suggests, I’ll be talking about <em>the other stuff</em> today.</p>
<p>First thing on the agenda, Ludum Dare. I wanted to follow up that prior post of mine with a brief finale post. Wednesday night I flipped the switch and revealed the results to Ludum Dare 14, our biggest competition yet. Amazingly, we missed only 2 entries the night of the competition. So the final total was 123 entries. Wow!</p>
<p>Rather than repeat all the subtle details, you can check out my <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2009/05/06/ludum-dare-14-results-now-available/">news post on the ludumdare.com</a>. Notable extras include <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2009/05/06/ludum-dare-14-time-lapse-videos/">18 time-lapse videos</a>, 2 of those being fully produced episodes of an internet video show by one of our regulars/admins. It’s very cool to see what interesting ways our community and event have evolved over the past 7 years.</p>
<p>Ludum Dare got a mention on <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/05/ludum_dare_14_results_top_scor.php">Game Set Watch</a>. Also <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/04/freeware_game_pick_portwall_ld.html">a few</a> <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/04/freeware_game_pick_you_got_a_d.html">entries</a> <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/04/freeware_game_pick_mind_wall_s.html">were</a> <a href="http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/04/freeware_game_pick_tombed_aunt.html">noted</a> on IndieGames.com, and via a syndicated article on <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23338">Gamasutra</a>.</p>

<p>Next on the agenda, book. I hinted at this earlier in the year. On and off over the past few months, I wrote a chapter for an iPhone Game Development book. I sent what might be my final edits about a week ago, so I might be done now. Before spilling the beans about the project, I wanted to see the book on Amazon first.</p>
<p>And… well… guess what?</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/iphonebook.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The book is a collection of articles written by iPhone game developers. It’s <em>almost</em> like a Game Programming Gems for iPhone, with 10 articles in total.</p>
<p>The book has an interesting motif. It’s written from the perspective of <em>“Hey, I’m an iPhone game developer, and I made this game. Here’s something interesting I did in my game, and how I did it”</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I can say what the other authors wrote, but I will say I wrote a chapter on portability. I’ve mentioned here a few times already, but Smiles was developed mostly on Windows. I built a custom library that wrapped SDL+OpenGL for PC/Linux ports, and iPhone OS+OpenGL ES for the iPhone port. In my chapter I walk through some pros/cons of working portably, and talk about what and how you need to work in order for the code to be easily portable. I finish off with a neat little physics demo-game that’ll compile and run on any SDL supported platform, and the iPhone (native iPhone code, not the SDL port).</p>
<p>I’ll have more to say about my thoughts on the writing process another time. I want to hold a finished printed copy of the book in my hand first. 🙂</p>
<p>(Note: Add “Author” to credentials)</p>
<p>– – – –</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.antairgames.com/blog/">Gavin Bowman</a> (one of my twitter cohorts) started a <em>feature</em> for The Apple Blog called <a href="http://theappleblog.com/tag/app-store-roundtable/">The App Store Round-table</a>. There’s a group of iPhone developers commenting on subjects on a mailing list, and Gavin assembles an article with notable quips from that discussion. Anyways, things I’ve said have come up twice. 😉</p>
<p>– <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/04/29/app-store-roundtable-the-gold-rush/">The Gold Rush</a></p>
<p>– <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/05/06/app-store-roundtable-transparency-and-the-approval-system/">Transparency and the Approval System</a></p>
<p>Both comments are actually from a response back when he pitched us the idea a few months ago, so maybe they’re not the most up to date (yet). Still, I think it’s a neat project to be involved in. Plus The iPhone Blog <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2008/12/03/smiles-who-you-lookin-at/">spoke highly of Smiles</a>, which is always an easy to make me like you. 😀</p>
<p>That’s it for now. I have a little more work I’d like to do on “the new project” before I start spilling all the details. Until then.</p>
