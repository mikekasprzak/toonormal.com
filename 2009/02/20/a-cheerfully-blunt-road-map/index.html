  <div class="post-content"><p>Alright, so the clock says it‚Äôs Friday now. According to my whiteboard, that‚Äôs 29 days before I leave for the Game Developers Conference. Between now and then, I have a few commitments to take care of. Possibly a 2nd draft for my writing engagement, jury (selection?) duty, in addition to IGF preparations. It‚Äôs also an important turning point for <strong>Smiles</strong> as a product and a brand.¬† Lets talk about that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smiles-game.com"><strong>Smiles</strong></a> has been a reasonable success.</p>
<p>Financially it‚Äôs no <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/01/profits-from-ishoot-iphone-game-cause-developer-to-quit-job.ars">iShoot</a>, but it‚Äôs done decently. If I hadn‚Äôt already left my cozy mainstream game industry job, I‚Äôd be seriously considering it. Long term scribblings and business plans would have filled my notebooks</p>
<p>Game industry notoriety wise, it‚Äôs an <a href="http://www.igfmobile.com/02finalists.html">IGF Mobile finalist</a> (for best game no less). An IGF nod is exactly what I aimed for as I stepped out of the usual 9-6 game industry day job.</p>
<p>And the game has been praised by <strong>every</strong> site that has reviewed it.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs everything you shoot for as a independent developer.</p>
<p>The problem is the exposure and sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Smiles</strong> thus far has lived entirely outside every top 100 list in the App Store. If you check <a href="http://www.mobclix.com">mobclix</a>, you‚Äôll note that the highest it‚Äôs been able to achieve is #146 on the free arcade games chart (<strong>Free Smiles</strong>). As a result, it survives entirely on word of mouth.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve since put some banner advertisements on a few of the larger iPhone sites, but real traffic seems to come only from distinct news posts about your game. Living outside the charts, every post is a lifeline. I can hope for that day Apple decides to feature me, but I shouldn‚Äôt hold my breath.</p>
<p>At the moment, and with GDC on the horizon, I have a good block of pre and post conference publicity available to me. That‚Äôs maybe a good 2 months of spotlight. But after that, it‚Äôs back to being lost in the vast Sea of iPhone apps.</p>
<p>So what‚Äôs next?</p>
<p>One option is to continue supporting the game, new updates, features, and so on.¬† The problem is that <strong>Smiles</strong> as a product already contains arguably well over <strong>$5</strong> worth of content and extras, and asking for more as an unknown would be murder. Asking for <strong>$5</strong> is already far too much in the eyes of the majority. I had to split the game in half (<strong>Smiles Zen</strong>, <strong>Smiles Drop</strong>) to show the value of the product. There‚Äôs always room for minor updates, but you should always be moving forward.</p>
<p>The other option, start game #2. Good in the long term, as multiple products tend to help sell each other. But in the short term, sales would die down to a crawl if I didn‚Äôt keep the exposure up. That wont kill me, but why let that happen?</p>
<p>Alright, so the 3rd option (or rather, what are you doing)?</p>
<p>Actually, there‚Äôs 2 things I‚Äôm going to do.</p>
<p>The first, I need to <strong>improve the brand and marketing</strong>. Not exactly spam the internet with more banners, but improve what and how I speak to the customer. My iTunes/App Store/all of descriptions are extremely vague. I approached the game marketing originally by pushing the game as mere cheerful and friendly product. Easy to play, and some actual depth to it. But that‚Äôs the same angle every other matching/casual game takes.</p>
<p><strong>Smiles</strong> is an IGF Mobile finalist. That means there‚Äôs <em>something</em> special about the game. Until you sit down and really play it, you‚Äôre completely unaware that the game is actually different. That‚Äôs one mistake I‚Äôve made.</p>
<p>Many of us gamers have fond memories of puzzle games. Tetris, Dr.Mario, Puzzle Bobble, etc. But not everyone has that same experience with Bejeweled. For many, that‚Äôs where our gaming tastes divided. Heck, I don‚Äôt care for it myself either. It‚Äôs slow. That‚Äôs what I changed in <strong>Smiles</strong>. I can‚Äôt be the first one first to have done it, but in my <em>research</em> reviewing games for <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com">Game Tunnel</a> I never found one that at least did this. If I am, shame on you casual games industry.</p>
<p>Conventional ‚Äúgamerized‚Äù casual games often hurt the truly casual appeal with timers and clocks. That‚Äôs stress. Many casual gamers play to relax and unwind. How can you do that when stressed? So I threw away the clocks and found ways to challenge you at a pace you control.</p>
<p>Also touch screens are intuitive. The control scheme of single touch actions on iPhone really makes it shine. Most people (especially new gamers) can move a finger faster and more accurately than they can with a mouse.</p>
<p>It all ties together in to a great little product, tuned specifically for the iPhone. The user base speaks highly of the game, which is great. But it‚Äôs a user base that grows only as new media outlets cover it at a reasonably frequency.</p>
<p>So this is goal number one. I need to improve the image of the game, be clearer what you‚Äôre getting as a consumer, give a stronger identity for media to grasp on to. It‚Äôs something special truly living in the obscurity in the App Store.¬† This is in preparation for the second part.</p>
<p>The second part, a <strong>cross platform strategy</strong>. In other words, make it available everywhere that‚Äôs practical.</p>
<p>To start, that mean PC, Mac and Linux. Actually, that‚Äôs already well underway. <strong>Smiles</strong> was actually developed on Windows and Linux, in addition to the Mac.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/00000fxx05.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/00000fxx06.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I come from a console game development background, so this has become standard stuff for me.</p>
<p>I spent a day this week troubleshooting graphics issues on an Intel GMA 945 graphics chipset. That works now, so the game will run on any reasonably recent PC. It‚Äôs hardware accelerated, relying heavily on fill rate. There are a hand full of changes that need to be made to suit the PC platforms, but it‚Äôs extremely playable as is.</p>
<p>So PC, Mac, and Linux are the immediate future of the <strong>Smiles</strong> game and brand. The goal being to expand the potential market before moving on to the next thing. Most the work is done already, it‚Äôs just a good couple weeks and some infrastructure away (not that I have that much time between now and GDC).</p>
<p>In addition, I‚Äôd like to pursue a <strong>console version</strong>. The original game assets <em>are</em> <em>HD 1080p ready</em>, though currently sized for the iPhone. The control scheme, while less efficient, could certainly be adapted to a D-Pad/Analogue Stick. And yeah, I realize a mere port to console is often not enough.</p>
<p>The console part may sound a bit ‚Äúpie in the sky‚Äù, but I‚Äôm actually quite familiar with the pitch process‚Ä¶ nearly an <em>expert</em> at turned down projects. üòâ Being a ‚Äúhome office‚Äù developer may work against me (7+1 prior Nintendo and a PlayStation game aside), but hey, I‚Äôm serious about this.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll be at GDC in March, where anything can happen. I‚Äôm a game industry veteran with <a href="/about/">12 very real</a> products in my portfolio, a low burn rate, and I know how to outsource if needed. I don‚Äôt need a job or an agent, just an avenue. Come find me at the IGF Mobile pavilion, I‚Äôd love to chat. üôÇ</p>
<p>And there it is. Certainly a lot more blunt than I‚Äôve been, but it‚Äôs ‚Äúno more Mr. Nice Mike‚Äù time.¬† üòÄ</p>
