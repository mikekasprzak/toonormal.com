  <div class="post-content"><p>This past weekend I began a process of rebranding my company. Shortly after leaving my AAA job in 2005, I created this logo.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SykLogo_Brown.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Thing is, that’s not even one of the better logos I used, it’s just the most business’y one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="/2005/11/27/classic-logos/">More here</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, I used to be really in to playing with typography. Sykhronics is a name I’ve been using for the past 15 years. In the early days, it was my portfolio website. When I decided to go “Fulltime Indie”, it became my business. It’s always been the hub of “me”; Whatever “me” is doing.</p>
<p>I’ve tried on <a href="/2010/11/14/tales-of-a-silent-h/">several ocassions</a> to come up with something better, but it just hadn’t worked out.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogo7.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Yay! There we go! Lots of things going on here, but most importantly I was able to creatively satisfy my type design itch.</p>
<p>The process involved me going to twitter and asking a simple question: Read this, and what does it say?</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NewSykLogoWhite.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Some of the results were extremely amusing (SykBronies!? Ha!). So after several iterations, we ended up with the orange logo above.</p>
<p>Notably absent is the H from Sykhronics. If you’ve never heard of Sykhronics, you’re probably asking “why was there an H there anyway?”. Well after some thought, lots of head tilting back and forth, I decided to try it without. I think “H less” SYKRONICS makes a lot of sense. The only downside is my own natural instinct typing it and reading it. My muscle memory for typing Sykhronics is so well developed, that I know when I’ve typed it wrong without even looking. Hey, that’s what happens after 15 years. 😉</p>
<p>Now the logo isn’t perfect. I’ve had several folks call out the K and the C for looking like “WTF” and E. I’m okay with that, because overall the design is consistent and interesting. 9 characters, all with hints of a circle in them, with sharp cuts.</p>
<p>Something I’ve wanted in the logo forever is a character. So part of the design is the O creature. It’s very much Pata Pon’esc, which I’m always a iffy about (looking too much like an existing franchise), but it’s fine. I like it. It’s interesting. Like a little floating eyeball with fangs. Gives me *SOMETHING* to use as a mascot, which I’ve always wanted.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’ve gone ahead and printed some biz cards. They look like this.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SykBizCard-PlasticFinal.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I’ve always been of the opinion that as a game developer, our business is fun, so we should be having fun everywhere. Hence why I went with such a bizarre job title (Formerly just “Game Developer, Owner”).</p>
<p>And that’s that. So far I’ve just started with the biz cards. After GDC I’ll make it the website too. Ta!</p>
