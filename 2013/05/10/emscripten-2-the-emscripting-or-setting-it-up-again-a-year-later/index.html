  <div class="post-content"><p>So last year, <a href="http://twitter.com/laufman">Derek</a> and I created a little game called <a href="http://sykhronics.com/nook/">Nook</a>. Nook was an interesting game that was half JavaScript and half C++, running in the browser (as 100% JavaScript). Things were still new with <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki">Emscripten</a>. At the time it had only recently reached the point where it could work with standard C++ libraries without issue. Performance claims were about 6x slower than native. Everything worked out great, so I did little writeup on it:</p>
<p><a href="/2012/04/27/nook-and-emscripten-a-technical-look-at-c-gamedev-in-the-browser/">/nook-and-emscripten-a-technical-look/</a></p>
<p>There were some talks at GDC this year on <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki">Empscripten</a>, and regrettably I missed those. And just last week <a href="http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/">Unreal Engine 3</a> was ported to the browser using Emscripten. Thanks to recent optimization work, and the new <a href="http://asmjs.org/">AsmJS</a> spec, its seems Emscripten code is close to <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/FAQ">2x slower than Native</a> in AsmJS optimized browsers. And as always, a great place to hear about interesting new things with Emscripten is on the lead developers blog and twitter.</p>

<hr>
<p>Now formalities are out of the way, I‚Äôve given myself a new project: <strong>Squirrel VM</strong> in the browser.</p>
<p>This blog post wont cover ‚ÄúSquirrelyJS‚Äù (a nickname I just came up with for the project), but setting up Emscripten again.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-emscripten">Setting Up Emscripten</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve just recently installed a new hard drive in my laptop, so I need to reinstall Emscripten. I‚Äôll be following the tutorial here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Tutorial">https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Tutorial</a></p>
<p>Starting with the downloads, I had to install GIT (I‚Äôm an SVN guy). I like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/">TortoiseGIT</a>, because I also like <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html">TortoiseSVN</a> (and <a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/">TortoiseHG</a>). <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/">TortoiseGIT</a> requires <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">MSysGIT</a> to work.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth knowing that the Emiscripten you get out of GIT is the full thing usable as-is. No compiling is required. Once everything is installed correctly (Clang, Python), and your paths are set up correctly, it will work.</p>
<p>Python 2.7 I already had installed in <strong>C:\Python27</strong>. Emscrpten tries to be clever and use a file python2.exe, which doesn‚Äôt exist by default. This can be fixed later, but you can create a symlink, or make a copy of python.exe as python2.exe in the python directory. It‚Äôs 27k, so an extra copy of python.exe wont hurt.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Java is required to use the closure compiler (i.e. JavaScript optimizer). For some reason this isn‚Äôt mentioned in the setup instructions.</p>
<h2 id="building-llvmclang">Building LLVM+Clang</h2>
<p>I use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files">MinGW with MSys</a>, and while yes there is an ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù download on the Clang/LLVM page, I wasn‚Äôt able to get it working. So instead, I had to build it from source.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/959">DO NOT BUILD FROM SVN!</a> EMSCRIPTEN IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE CURRENT STABLE RELEASE! (Also skip the test-suite)</p>
<p>I followed the instructions here, with one change:</p>
<p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html">http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html</a></p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> USE AS REFERENCE ONLY! You should only ever use the <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.2">stable sources</a>. Uncompress clang in to the tools folder as suggested (renaming clang-3.2.src to just clang), and <strong>optionally</strong> in projects compiler-rt (renaming compiler-rt-3.2.src to just compiler-rt). Skip the test-suite.</p>
<p>My change I did ‚Äú<strong>../llvm/configure <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html">--enable-optimized --disable-assertions</a></strong>‚Äú, since I wanted a nice fast release build of LLVM+Clang, not a slower debug build with Asserts.</p>
<p>I also had to disable my current install of Clang, as it was trying to use Clang to build Clang+LLVM, which was broken. Only a problem if you tried to use the experimental package they provided.</p>
<p>An unfortunate downside, I was unable to use ‚Äú<strong>make -j 4</strong>‚Äú, which uses multiple cores to compile. This is the 2nd time in the years I‚Äôve been using MinGW+Msys I‚Äôve come across something that make‚Äôs -j hasn‚Äôt worked (I can‚Äôt remember what the other one was, but it was a few weeks ago). It deadlocked on compiling the 4th file, which is not a good way to finish building anything. üòâ</p>
<p>Compiling in a single thread took me <strong>over an hour</strong>. üôÅ</p>
<p>Once built, ‚Äú<strong>make install</strong>‚Äù to put it in my /usr/local/bin.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-your-system-for-emscripten">Configuring your system for Emscripten</h2>
<p>First things first, we‚Äôre going to need to set some environment variables. You can do that here:</p>
<p><strong>Control Panel-&gt;System-&gt;Advanced System Settings-&gt;Environment Variables</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Path</strong> is often the most important variable to tweak. Add new paths separated by semicolons (;). I added:</p>
<p>*<em>;C:\Python27;C:\Emscripten*</em></p>
<p>There are some <strong>optional</strong> environment variables you can add here too.</p>
<p><strong>EMSCRIPTEN</strong> ‚Äì Where emscripten is (e.g. ‚ÄúC:\Emscripten&amp;#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>LLVM</strong> ‚Äì Where Clang+LLVM is. (e.g. ‚Äúc:\MinGW\msys\1.0\local\bin‚Äù).</p>
<p><strong>PYTHON</strong> ‚Äì Python executable. (i.e. ‚ÄúC:\Python27\python.exe‚Äù).</p>
<p>Browse to the Emscripten directory with MSys, and run the following.</p>
<p><strong>python emcc</strong></p>
<p>Because its the first run, this will create an Emscripten configuration file in your home folder. Mine was here:</p>
<p><strong>C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\Mike.emscripten</strong></p>
<p>In this file you can edit/set the location of Python, Clang/LLVM, etc. You can also change it from using <strong>python2.exe</strong> to <strong>python.exe</strong> if you want.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You need to set your temp directory. I modified the TEMP_DIR line as follows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After all, the rest of the lines in the file use this os.getenv function, so why not temp too?</p>
<p>Okay! That should be it.</p>
<p>Now if everything is set up correctly, you should be able to run <strong>clang</strong> and have it not crash.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You should also be able to run <strong>emcc</strong> without explicitly invoking python now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Node is NodeJS, the tool for running JS files on the command line (without an .html page).</p>
