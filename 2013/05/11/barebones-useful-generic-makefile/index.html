  <div class="post-content"><p>This seems to happen a lot for me. I’m testing/playing around with some code thing, and I set up some cheeseball compiling in a shell script. Then I get to a point and it’s just not enough, the compiling is taking too long, or so one. My major projects often have a nice makefile setup going, but my experiments, not so much. That’s because writing a makefile, despite being the same thing again and again for me, is tricky to get right.</p>
<p>So here’s a generic makefile I’d typically use. I’m posting it here so I can steal it as needed, but feel free to use it and hack away at it; That’s what makefiles are for. 🙂</p>
<p>This makefile is designed for simple GCC/G++ usage. It’s designed to put temporary/object files in an “<strong>obj/</strong>” folder, and the final binary in the “<strong>output/</strong>” folder. Also the generated file can be executed from the make command (via ‘make run’). If you have a specific set of command line arguments you want to pass to the program, specify them in the ARGS variable.</p>
<p>Lines that are too long should end with a “&amp;#8221; character, which continues on to the next line. <strong>Make sure there are no spaces after the “&amp;#8221;!!!</strong></p>
<p>I’ve also included an optional common tweak I often do. Un-comment the SRC_PREFIX line to assume all code files and paths specified are in a “<strong>src/</strong>” folder.</p>
