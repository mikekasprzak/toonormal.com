    <p>And here we are. Hopefully, it’s the start of a more regular practice. You’ve probably read the brief Manifesto to the right. This was written some 9 months ago. And now, since things are a tad more orderly, it’s time to expand on that.
Sykhronics, pronounced “psi-cron-icks”. A branding of Mike Kasprzak’s independent game works. Established in 1998, replacing my older branding Gamma Flare Games. After bouncing around the gracious hosting of a few friends, I acquired the “dot com” in 2000....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>February the 1st. I’m mere minutes away from missing this chance to post and make the first of this month, yet I prevail. Ha ha!
Hopefully, I’m finally getting my act together. We’re already a month in to 2006, and really I haven’t had much to show. It seems I’ve been in a less than ideal situation up until recently. It’s resolution was equally as not so idealistic, so excuse me as I be vague, until the day we all look back and laugh about it....</p>

    <h2>Slamming from far away</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Slamdance was last week. PuffBOMB was a finalist for the PopCap award. A game by the name of Odyssey took the award. Congratz to them. The rest of the results can be found here.
It’s a shame, but I couldn’t make it out this year. That, and I’m still getting things off the ground here at Syko. I had heard from my “contact” there would be some PuffBOMB action at the festival, but so far my search for evidence has come up short....</p>

    <h2>December&amp;#8217;s Round Up of the Odd</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yes, your monthly dose of round uppage is online.
After having many great games these past few round up’s, it was expected things would cool down. This month has some cool stuff, but nothing that’s going to pull a Weird Words or such on you. The Mastermind being my favorite of the month, despite it being depressingly buggy. This followed by the funky physics motorcycle game Motorama, some addiction to Egypt with Egyptian Addiction, and a healthy dose of shooting and space games, and some Arkanoids for good measure....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yes, it is certainly a newer year than before, and yet, I’m 3 weeks behind in declaring it as such. Ahh, this whole time thing you corporeal types take for granola.
I’m busy getting things in order on this side of screen. Big year, lots to do. Many sites that need work, and a game development crunch to kick off soon. Stay tuned. Check back every minute. ‘cmon, show my host how much you love it....</p>

    <h2>2005 Games in Review</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Inspired by a discussion on Indie Gamer, and Game Tunnel’s end of year awards. Apparently it wasn’t clear, but us round up’ers were not involved in the end of year awards. So, to make up for it, I’m going to pick my favorites from the last year (December to November’s round up). I’m not going to rate them, just list them. Here we go.

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The roundup for November is up, just in time for the big day December 25th. 10 again this time.
Many good games this month. Land of Legends, the fantasy strategy game in the top spot, followed by the wildlife park simulator Venture Africa, a hardcore space trading sim Flatspace II, an aquarium store simulator Fish Tycoon, and a slick little soccer player simulator New Star Soccer 3. Good stuff....</p>
