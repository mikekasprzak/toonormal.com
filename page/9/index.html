    <h2>Git Notes on Combining Repositories</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Just some notes. Recently, I had to merge and organize 3 repositories as one, so here are the things I ended up doing.
Merging 2 repositories in to one with full history In my case, the local repository (source) was project-a, and the public repository (destination) was project-b.
When I was finished merging, instead of git push -u I had to push it like so:

    <p>It‚Äôs true. After 10 years, I‚Äôll be wrapping up my games business. Later this year, I‚Äôll be moving on to other things.
I am still going to be around. I‚Äôd still like to attend GDC in San Francisco every year. Ludum Dare is a thing I‚Äôll continue to work on and run (and if I‚Äôm lucky, I might be able to enter again some day). I‚Äôm also going to continue doing little projects that amuse me, things like my Commodore 64 game from New Years....</p>

    <h2>Boost without Bullshit (boost-wobs)</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>After some friends were ranting about Boost on twitter, I decided to do something about the single Boost dependency in my game code‚Ä¶ but not the usual thing (rewriting it).
I‚Äôve been using Boost‚Äôs operators.hpp for nearly a decade, because it actually makes writing operator code cleaner. Alas, my trimmed down subset of Boost was bringing nearly 60 source files with it, just for one file. That‚Äôs dumb. Thus, Boost without Bullshit was born:...</p>

    <h2>When and why use UTF-8 and UTF-16? Stringy thoughts.</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This was a bit of a shower thought, but until this I didn‚Äôt have a good reason to choose UTF-16 for anything.
UTF-8 makes a lot of sense. It has all the benefits of ASCII text formatting, and the ability to support additional characters above and beyond the ASCII 127 or 254. It‚Äôs very similar to ASCII, you just have to be careful with your null and extended codes. No arguments here....</p>

    <h2>cJSON-LAX (Relaxed) on GitHub</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Today I made some modifications to cJSON, a JSON parsing C library. And like a good boy, I‚Äôve made them available on GitHub.
https://github.com/povrazor/cjson-lax
The changes are against the strict JSON spec, but instead are usability improvements:
 Add C style /* Block Comments */ and C&#43;&#43; style // Line Comments. Added support for Tail Commas on the LAST LINES of Arrays and Objects  The benefits of comments in JSON should be obvious, but Tail Commas are quite the nicety....</p>

    <h2>Linux (Ubuntu) 2015 Setup Notes</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Hello 2015. The laptop I‚Äôve been using the past few years actually fell apart, so I bought a new one. I started using Linux (Ubuntu) almost exactly 1 year ago, and as much as I like it, it‚Äôs not always the most logical and obvious OS to use, so I take notes. Here are notes.
The machine is a Lenovo X230 Tablet. It‚Äôs actually an older laptop, a 2013 model, but to put things mildly 2014 was NOT a good year for Lenovo Thinkpads....</p>

    <p>Most people don‚Äôt know we have a blog syndication sub-site on Ludum Dare called the Ludum Dare Planet. It‚Äôs an extra WordPress blog and site that eats very few resources, but still needs to be regularly updated.
For the sake of security, I‚Äôll be taking the down the planet website. I‚Äôm going to wait a few days first, but if nobody responds, I‚Äôll just take it down. If you need time to grab your favorite RSS feeds, come to my blog (http://toonormal....</p>

    <p>This is just an idea I‚Äôve had. I wanted to write it down in some meaningful way so that I can rediscover it later. This is less a C&#43;&#43;‚Äôism, and more a JavaScript/Squirrel‚Äôism.

In any situation where your user interface presents a popup dialog, that process of presenting the dialog should be a function call. Here is pseudocode:
