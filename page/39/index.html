Right. Things are back and working in the Mike camp. Back to the grind and all. I’ve also recently finished a drawing pad, after slightly over 3 months. Doesn’t sound like much, but looking back it’s been taking me up to a year to fill one up.
So IGF finalists have been announced. Funky. So many great games have been coming out later in the year, I’m not surprised PuffBOMB didn’t place....</p>

    <p>Crud. This’d normally be a good place to stick an image, but that’s the problem.
Tuesday evening, I’m minding my own business playing a game on my laptop, when suspiciously my desktop PC reboots. I thought nothing of it, and continued playing. Several hours later, I’m shutting everything down for the night, and I find the desktop locking up in the Bios detecting the IDE devices. Whatever, we’ll look in to it in the morning....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Whilst writing my recent post on the updated logo for the business transition of the branding, I was inspired to take a look at the progression of Sykhronics logos over the years. Some of the more recent logos are custom designed fonts, which is something I plan to again some day with the logo.
Kenny Thornton, and the guys at Execute (a long since abandoned group). Kenny was the only one to ever release anything under the branding, so it’s pretty much his....</p>

    <p>There’s been a lot going on, which I’ll go in to in further posts. This one’s on Logos.
Way back in July I dropped a note about some Rejected Logos. I still haven’t decided what I want, but I’ve been back playing the logo making game.
Ahh yes, a smooth graphic design’ish logo. Hurah.
Do I like it? I’m not sure. I’m torn between going with something more cartoony, or including a little face in the logo....</p>

    <h2>October Tunnels, MD</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The round up for October is up, sporting the sexah new look for the Game Tunnel website. This month sees Russell joining the ranks of the illustrious panel, bringing us to 4. It also shows us taking a more reserved 10 game count, which I think we’ll be sticking with moving forward.
So, how was the month? Two games I really liked this month, Weird Worlds and Cute Knight. Just as I said in my review, and as the others agreed, Weird Worlds is great....</p>

    <p>Yep, I died. No, wait.
I’ve been busy pulling a prototype together. I’m afraid I don’t have much to say just yet. I have a pretty ambitious goal to meet by the end of this month, and I’ll gladly talk about it then. I even brought on some help, as I think timing is crucial.
If this works out, we should see some PuffBOMB action in about a year.
I like consoles....</p>

    <p>The September Tunneling is up, and extra shiny. It was a light month, so we had to go back, and pick up a few from earlier in the year. Kisses, Zombie Smashers and Heavy Weapon being your older games. Personal favorites for this month would include The Strategist, Virus and The Goat in the Grey Fedora.
Doing the reviews like we do (blind, we don’t see each others scores until we’re all done), I always seem to have a game or two scoring regret....</p>

    <p>I’ve been trying to come up with a 3rd character to go along with the hamster and the robot for PuffBOMB. When I started redesigning the game, I wanted at least a male and a female character, but ended up with 2 males (3 if you count a butch hamster that I’d recently replaced with the robot).
It seems I have something. What you see to the right is a concept for the potted plant girl character....</p>

    <p>Oh don’t be scared baby, I’m still here.
Yes, it seems I’ve been neglecting posting. On the plus side, there’s been some major progress, but equally major distractions. Since apparently leaving a job clearly means “2 month vacation”, there I was back at Big Blue for a week. All was good though. I was asked to help a struggling project meet a milestone, and that seemed to go well. Twas also nice to hang out with the guys there again, a fine group I must say....</p>
