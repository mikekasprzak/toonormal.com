    <h2>Try IGF Mobile Finalist Smiles for Free</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yep, it‚Äôs been in the pipeline since Saturday. Free Smiles is now available. It gives you both games to try (Zen and Drop).
Zen is the patience game. A unique game that‚Äôs like the combination of Solitaire and a Match 3. Free Smiles includes a single puzzle.
Drop is both a relaxing and action puzzler. It‚Äôs unique combination of timerless play, with various optional easy twitch gaming features like making multiple matches while other clear, twisting the iPhone, and floaters....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of Smiles, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.
To start, I‚Äôm going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year....</p>

    <h2>Physics in Smiles</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>At first glance you wouldn‚Äôt think a matching game like Smiles would feature physics, but it does. In several places actually.
The most obvious example is the particle effects.
Particles were used when ice and rocks break, and also for the tile clearing effect. The tile would be erased instantly from the board, and a particle would be created in it‚Äôs place. The particle would zoom in, slow down, then zoom out with a twist....</p>

    <h2>Amusing bugs/oddities developing Smiles</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I kept video of some of my more interesting bugs/glitches/oddities in Smiles. Some more silly than others.
The first I want to show is a bug in one of the effects for the game mode Zen. It was supposed to be a ‚Äútoss a rock in to a pond‚Äù water ripple. It didn‚Äôt really work as expected.

Here‚Äôs what it was supposed to look like. Cool looking, but the problem with this was the effect would make you queasy....</p>
