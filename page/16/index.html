    <h2>AppDailySales, and running on Synology NAS Devices</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Continuing my prior post where I talk about my server replacement, a Synology NAS (DS211j). In essence, a cheap, tiny dedicated Linux box featuring an ARM CPU and custom web UI specially designed for SUPER EASY RAID array maintenance and creation. There‚Äôs a 4 drive version, some many-more drive versions, but they cost more.
This time, I‚Äôm here to talk about a little tool for getting your daily sales data from Apple‚Äôs iTunes Connect website. AppDailySales!
http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/
This is a python script I was recommended some months back, but it needed a few things IMO. So in a shocking rare case of OSS justice, I added the features I wanted myself and submitted a patch:
http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/issues/detail?id=31&amp;can=1
Just a few days ago (nine months later), version 2.9 was released (sparked by Apple‚Äôs change to the system), now including my patches! üòÄ
To run the script, all you need is Python. Before I used to run this on Windows XP (Python installed in C:\Python2.7, with PATH environment variable set to include this).
Now with the NAS, I SSH in to the device (Go download Putty if on Windows), login as root (same password as admin), and install the python package.
ipkg install python
Easy. Done.
Place the AppDailySales.py script somewhere on your computer, likely in the same folder you want your stats placed. Then simply invoke it with ‚Äìhelp to get a list of arguments.
python appdailysales.py --help
I run it from a batch file or script. My old Batch File Version looks like this:
The new, shockingly similar shell script version (i.e. only single %‚Äôs) is this:
This creates files like so:
2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-13.txt&lt;br /&gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-12.txt&lt;br /&gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-11.txt&lt;br /&gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-10.txt
Nice and easy to read names, unlike the default files generated by iTunes Connect.
In the next section, I‚Äôll talk more about setting it up as a service. In other words, totally automated!

    <h2>I am running a Synology NAS now</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Last week, a drive in my server died. These drives weren‚Äôt really that old, but were Seagate‚Äôs from the drive failing epidemic a few years back. I bought 6 drives around this time, 4 for the server in a RAID 10 array, 2 for my workstation. I lost 1 to the failure problem, and the rest I managed to get updated firmwares installed in time.
Since then, I have been extremely leery of Seagate drives. My server ran Windows XP (yes), and used the on-board Intel SATA RAID controller of this MOBO. On several occasions, the RAID integrity would fail for no good reason upon bootup, that I simply stopped turning my server off.
My brother the ‚Äúprofessional network admin‚Äù has been reminding me for years that Software Linux RAID is the best RAID. So after this tragic failure (no data lost, just some hair), it was time for something different.
My brother and I have been talking NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices for a while, he himself trying a few over the years, to really sub-par results. Generally, the prices were terrible for completely sub par hardware that couldn‚Äôt perform. Popular NAS like the Drobo start at like $700, yuck! The best bang for buck always seemed to be building a server.
Actually, bang for buck wise, building your own file server is still cheaper. But Linux is a delicate mistress. I am a coder, and dealing with game console development tools and Linux setups over the years has taught me how to live comfortably in Linux. I work on Windows though, just I do it with Cygwin and MinGW/MSys.
That aside, there is still too much sh*t to learn about Linux. Time is money. Building and maintaining another server, I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt want to do it (FreeNAS was suggested on my Twitter, for anyone in a more adventurous mood).
It‚Äôs 2011, give me a drop in solution that‚Äôs cheap, small, fast and good!
Blam! Hello Synology DS211j!
This 2 drive consumer model rakes in at around $200, size not much larger than an eternal casing, and sporting a 1.2 GHz ARM processor. ARM! Hey! I know those!
It runs a breed of Linux, interfaces via gorgeous fast HTML UI, and support fancy Linux favorites like SSH out-of-the-box. Well not quite out-of-the-box, as you do need to download the latest firmware and a setup tool for your OS, but that‚Äôs easy.
Mine I filed with a pair of 3TB Hitachi Deskstar drives, spinning at 7200 RPMS with 64 MB of cache. Western Digital Caviar Green drives were $40 cheaper each, but are known to be slow and problematic on RAIDs (though there are fixes, a tool WDidle3 seems to address this). Again, time is da mon-nay, and wanted something I could just drop in. Benchmarks said these drives were better overall performers too, so hey, why not!
Hardware setup was a matter of unboxing, opening it (sliding case sides front and back to unlock), plugging my drives in, screwing them in, and closing the casing (opposite of opening). I think I had this done in 5 minutes, max. Didn‚Äôt even need a manual.
Building the array I wanted (MODE 1) was extremely straightforward, that I wont both talking about it.
What I will talk about is some of the advanced stuff I wanted from it, and the configuring done to make it act accordingly. After all, this blog post is actually for me, so I can know what I did in case I need to reproduce it.

    <h2>On the Journey to Live Coding</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This past couple weeks I‚Äôve been busily working on architecting many little things (super important things) for my new game. One of the big things I really didn‚Äôt set out to do initially, but once I realized my efforts were converging there, I decided to make it a priority: Live Coding.
I am using a scripting language Squirrel to handle the gameplay side of the programming. This is new for me, having hardcoded or written my own sub-par scripting and data entry dialects to make my prior games....</p>

    <h2>Premake: My new best friend (RE: MSVC &amp;#038; Xcode)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Alright, I‚Äôve spammed the twitterverse enough.
Here‚Äôs something I started playing with today, and finished just a few hours later, satisfied. Premake. In essence, it‚Äôs a build script and project file maker, just like CMake and Scons. It uses Lua scripting, to contrast custom and python for the others (CMake a Scons respectfully).
If you weren‚Äôt me, you could save yourself a slew of portability headaches with this simple script.
(From here)
Stick that in a folder with code, or code found in some directories. Then from a command-line, invoke the tool premake4 as follows:
premake4 --file=myfile.lua vs2008
Blam! Your prize, a Visual Studio 2008 project file and solution. Want 2010? Just change the argument.
Want it building elsewhere? Walk over to your Linux box, or your Cygwin/MinGW shell, and do this:
premake4 --file=myfile.lua gmake
You now have a makefile.
Of course, anyone that‚Äôs done project management knows that the above is just your most basic of projects. Standard C/C&#43;&#43; libraries, and whatnot. Per platform you still need to link versus external libraries (OpenGL, SDL, etc). No problem, just add new sections to your targets. includedirs, libs, libdirs, and so on. Want to apply a setting to both? just place it a level up in the hierarchy. Nearly everything you would normally do on a platform, there‚Äôs a means of adding content to that.
Honestly, there‚Äôs little point having me regurgitate how to start using it, as the docs have a wonderful tutorial that steps through it. And once you get to the files stage of the tutorial, you can generate a usable project file with just that. Here‚Äôs the link:
http://industriousone.com/solutions-and-projects
My one last tip though, is that the scripting interface is doing some housekeeping behind the scenes. The functions Solution, Project, and Configuration specifically. Calling them changes the scope of the calls that follow. This is important to note if you try to use normal Lua scripting activities, a ‚Äúprintf‚Äù will write to the console as the project is generated, but not while it runs. There‚Äôs a command for setting the actions at each stage.
Oh, and you can invoke MSBUILD from the command-line if you want to live in shell land (like me). Start a Visual Studio 2008 shell (under Start Menu/Visual Studio 2008/Visual Studio Tools/..), then browse to and invoke it as follows.
msbuild MySolution.sln /property:Configuration=Debug
And presto. Your actual errors will be logged to the console window.
* * *
So hey, ahem, back on topic. If you‚Äôre not me, you can use something like this to do your project management work. I however have and REALLY LIKE a fancy GNU make based build system I wrote. Unfortunately, this only helps me when I‚Äôm developing for Windows, Linux, and certain devices. It does no good when I am actually required to use Visual Studio (certain libraries, DRM, SDK‚Äôs), or Xcode on Mac. But that‚Äôs where Premake comes in, to take care of that stuff for me.
I have some wild plans ahead, but I wanted my original working script available somewhere. Hit the jump for the full listing.
Remember, it‚Äôs Lua, so double dashes are line comments.
