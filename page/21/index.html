    <p>Heh, I certainly wasn‚Äôt expecting this.
RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I‚Äôm now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I‚Äôve been using UltraVNC on my PC‚Äôs recently, though I do run their iPhone client. üòâ
Thanks for the tip Adam.

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I have a goal of switching my focus entirely to a new project starting in July, which is about 6 weeks away. My 30th birthday is the 6th, so my folks have been joking that‚Äôll be my gift to myself. Happy Birthday Mike, you can do something else now‚Ä¶ heh.
So to make that happen, I need to power through my list of pending platforms I want to cover, before back-burner‚Äôing the rest....</p>

    <p>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I‚Äôve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!
Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‚Äòeh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).
The past week I‚Äôve been busy with a variety of things....</p>

    <h2>Smiles running on the Palm Pre, plus other things</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the sessions I saw at GDC this year was Palm‚Äôs talk about their new PDK (i.e. their native SDK). The promise was a Linux based mobile device featuring SDL and OpenGL ES. Since my Windows and Linux code base also uses SDL and OpenGL, that certainly caught my attention. In theory, all I need to do is just recompile my Linux version with their tools and I‚Äôm done, right?...</p>

    <p>And it‚Äôs that time again too. Ludum Dare #17 is coming up next weekend. If the idea of crunching together a game from scratch in 48 hours interests you, check us out.
Now, this compo has been a little different. We announced our date nice and early, so the people at GDC would know about it, and to save us from silly ‚Äúwhen will the compo be?‚Äù questions. So really, it was probably our best pre-announcement for a compo date to date....</p>

    <h2>Automobiles, Interviews, all Smiles</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel‚Äôs AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement....</p>

    <h2>PuffBOMB Featured on GameJolt</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I‚Äôm actually in the middle of a rather large post, but I still felt this was worth noting (while inappropriate for the other post). PuffBOMB, my explosive little freeware game is currently featured on GameJolt.

GameJolt is a unique games website that‚Äôs a bit like a ‚ÄúKongregate‚Äù for freeware. I put PuffBOMB up there some time last week to try it out, and it‚Äôs pretty cool.
The site has a neat feature for downloading and playing PC games right from the browser....</p>

    <h2>Smiles HD bug list (and launch day thoughts)</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I‚Äôll talk a little more about the ‚Äúday 1 FREE‚Äù experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn‚Äôt going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device....</p>

    <p>It took all night, but Smiles HD has finally made it on to the Top 100 FREE games chart!

I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better way to end the night. Thanks everyone! Keep spreading the word, and have fun with Smiles HD on your iPads!

Remember: Smiles HD is FREE *ONLY* until the end of the day April 3rd! Regular price, $4.99. I think you‚Äôll agree, it‚Äôs worth at least that....</p>
