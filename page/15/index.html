    <p>I run an online game-jam event called Ludum Dare, and this past weekend I got together with a friend (Derek Laufman of Halfbot) and we made a game. What did we make? A platformer about size.
The game was created over a period 72 hours. Somehow, amazing to me, we managed to pull it together despite our responsibilities.
 Me running the event (Ludum Dare) Family gathering at my brothers I attended on the Saturday Car appointment on Monday Derek taking care of his baby  Fortunately, running Ludum Dare is only busy for me before the event, and at submission time (two of them, 3-5 hours each). During the event I‚Äôm free to sit down and do whatever I want. This weekend was the Diablo 3 beta test, and if I was a lesser man, I‚Äôd have played that. Fortunately for me, Derek came to me a couple weeks ago and suggested we make a game together, I said yes, and the rest is history.
It‚Äôs totally silly, but I‚Äôm actually proud of the fact that I managed to attend the family gathering and the car appointment. Stupid me, I could have actually cancelled/rescheduled the appointment for Tuesday or Wednesday, but I decided to go ahead with it anyway. The car appointment was my yearly service for my smartcar, and I ended up staying in the neighborhood of the dealership for about 5 hours of that day. Working on my Ludum Dare game on my laptop, I had WIFI at the dealership, and also McDonalds, where I parked myself for a couple hours. To be honest, this was probably the first time I seriously ‚ÄúCoffee Shop Developed‚Äù, and where I actually got some serious work done. It was fun, because it was out of the ordinary. üôÇ
Anyways, that‚Äôs enough back story. Lets get nerdy.

Hello! This is quite possibly the last post I‚Äôll do in 2011, so lets make with the goods!
This past week I‚Äôve continued working on the demake of my primary project. If you checked out the Ludum Dare prototype, the core mechanics have dramatically improved since then (about 4 days ago)....</p>

    <p>I wont talk too much about how Ludum Dare itself went, as I‚Äôve already done that over here.
But in addition to running the event, I participated for the first time in a long time. The theme was ‚ÄúAlone‚Äú, which I find funny given the title of my game. Could I not enter? üòâ
About a week before Ludum Dare, I started toying with the idea of creating a demake of my game....</p>

    <h2>A Better MinGW &#43; MSys Shell</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Pekka posed a good question recently that got me thinking: The default Bash shell that comes with MinGW (MSys) kinda sucks. You can‚Äôt resize the Window, selections are this odd visible only thing, in essence: it works like an ordinary windows cmd shell.
The solution is surprisingly straight forward: Use MinTTY.
Open up a MinGW shell, and do the following:
 mingw-get install mintty
 A few moments later, you‚Äôll have MinTTY installed....</p>

Against my better judgement, I‚Äôm going to stop beating around the bush and show you:
