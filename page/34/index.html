    <h2>2D Illustrator or Animator needed</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This posting has been filled. Thanks everyone.

Here’s a little job posting that I’ve started to circulate.
[edit] Edited, ’cause it was rather technical and mean sounding. – – – –
Hi there,
We’re looking for a skilled 2D illustrator or animator for a 2 month contract, to start some time in February. The work can be done remotely. This is a full time contract, and I expect it to be on par with industry wages....</p>

    <h2>Warmup Ludum Dare Compo 2007 &amp;#8211; Jan 26-28</h2>

Hey,
On the weekend of Jan 26-28 there will be an unofficial Ludum Dare warmup competition.
The compo will be held entirely in #ludumdare on irc.afternet.org. Final entries must be hosted on your own web space. Someone might put up a wiki, but that someone won’t be me – Theme choice will be discussed and voted on Jan 26 at 7pm PST....</p>

    <h2>It was fun while it lasted</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I like Slamdance. I entered PuffBOMB last year, and was a finalist for the casual game award. Since then, I’ve been excited that a more “artful” game competition was beginning to take off. Winners receive a funky ugly dog statuette. Cool! Then a controversial game was pulled. Things are not going well now.
It’s a real shame, and I hope something good comes from the controversy, rather than developing in to more Jack Thompson style heat for our industry....</p>

    <h2>Oh right, a compilation too</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>It seems I missed the memo.
The 2nd Independent Games compilation was released back in September (25th), and that PuffBOMB game I seem to talk about all the time was included.
As well, there was a set of concept art included in the package. Said art can also be seen right here.
I suppose I should go find a way to acquire a copy, ’cause I’m not sure what happened to a complimentary one....</p>

    <p>I’m actively preparing for … some event. On my to-do list for this miraculous day, is cleaning up the web sites. Well, I’ve finished 1 so far, the Sykhronics web site.
www.sykhronics.com
It’s not functional, but I think it looks cooler/more professional than before. I’ll make it usable at some later date.
Since it’s a new month, here’s a couple notable images from last month. The first is are a little sketch I did for each of my grandmother’s in their Christmas cards....</p>

    <h2>Sketch Dump, November 2006</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Had a harder time this month scrounging up content unrelated to PuffBOMB I liked.
To be an ass, and to make everybody (else) behind the scenes happy, I’m sitting on this stuff until we’ve pitch it (Mid January is our target). Lots of tweaking and tuning, especially in the art style area. Getting a background look I’m happy with has turned out to be more troublesome than I’d hoped. None the less, the battle rages on....</p>
