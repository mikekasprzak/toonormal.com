  <div class="post-content"><p>Hello 2015. The laptop I‚Äôve been using the past few years <em>actually</em> fell apart, so I bought a new one. I started using Linux (Ubuntu) almost exactly 1 year ago, and as much as I like it, it‚Äôs not always the most logical and obvious OS to use, so I take notes. Here are notes.</p>
<p>The machine is a <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=89ECFD45CA0654775864CDBAD2606AC7&amp;tabname=Features">Lenovo X230 Tablet</a>. It‚Äôs actually an older laptop, a 2013 model, but to put things mildly 2014 was <strong>NOT</strong> a good year for Lenovo Thinkpads. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/04/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-2015/">as of CES (today/yesterday), Thinkpads will return to being useful</a>.</p>
<p>Notable specs: Core i5 Processor with Hyperthreading. Intel HD 4000 GPU. 2x USB 3.0 ports, 1x USB 2.0 (powered). Oh, and of course it has a TrackPad, a IBM TrackPoint (red nub joystick mouse), a Touch Screen and a Wacom Digitizer (Pen).</p>
<p>I dropped a 500 GB Samsung SSD in to it, dedicated a 200 GB partition to Windows 7 Pro, and the rest to Ubuntu 14.10 (~260 GB, though I‚Äôm thinking about giving Windows a little more). I‚Äôve installed various dev tools and SDKs on both. As expected, Windows has used about 100 GB of its space, and Ubuntu about 20 GB. Typical. üòâ</p>
<h2 id="return-of-oibaf-bleeding-edge-video-drivers">Return of Oibaf (bleeding edge Video drivers)</h2>
<p>Setting up the machine went very smoothly, except for two issues:</p>
<p>‚Äì The Steam UI was ‚Ä¶ strange. Not slow, but unresponsive (had to right click to refresh)</p>
<p>‚Äì the Print Screen key (and scrot) could not take screenshots (they were wrong)</p>
<p>The solution was to upgrade the video driver. The very latest Intel and OSS drivers are always available as part of the Oibaf graphics driver package.</p>
<p><a href="https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers">https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers</a></p>
<p>To add them, add the PPA, and do an upgrade:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To remove them, use ppa-purge:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The latest-and-greatest drivers can sometimes be risky to use. I normally don‚Äôt use them, but for a time I did, and all was fine until Mesa mainline got busted. Sadly oibaf doesn‚Äôt keep ‚Äúlast known good drives‚Äù around, only the bleeding edge, so I only recommend it if all else fails.</p>
<h2 id="skype-tray-icon-fix">Skype Tray Icon Fix</h2>
<p>Skype is a 32bit app running on 64bit Linux. To correctly make tray icons work, this package fixes it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Download it, and restart Skype.</p>
<h2 id="tlp-8211-advanced-linux-power-management">TLP ‚Äì Advanced Linux Power Management</h2>
<p>This little piece of software dramatically improves my Linux battery life. I had used it in the past, but for a time I was using pre-release builds of Ubuntu, and no TLP update was available (I hadn‚Äôt learned about how to grab old versions of software from PPA‚Äôs yet).</p>
<p><a href="http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html">http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html</a></p>
<p>Installation is pretty easy. First add the PPA.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then grab the packages.</p>

<p>I run Thinkpad laptops, which there is extra software for.</p>

<h2 id="sdl2-setup">SDL2 Setup</h2>
<p>I always seem to forget the essentials needed to build SDL on Linux. Hopefully this list is correct.</p>

<h2 id="sdl_mixer-20-prerequisites-on-ubuntu">SDL_Mixer 2.0 Prerequisites on Ubuntu</h2>
<p>For OGG support do:</p>

<h2 id="running-emscripten">Running Emscripten</h2>
<p>The <strong>emrun</strong> tool can be used to quickly test Emscripten compiled apps.</p>
<p>First, compile with the command line option <strong><code>&quot;--emrun&quot;</code></strong>.</p>
<p>Then run the script:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/compiling/Running-html-files-with-emrun.html">More details</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sdl2-and-emscripten">SDL2 and Emscripten</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> SDL2 Emscripten support is brand-new. It was just added to mainline SDL on Xmas eve.</p>
<p>There are two ways to build SDL2 apps using Emscripten. The SDL way, and Emscripten way.</p>
<p>The SDL way is building SDL2 from source, using various Emscripten tools. There are notes about how to build SDL_mixer, but I was unable to get this working.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/817656bd36ec/docs/README-emscripten.md">https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/817656bd36ec/docs/README-emscripten.md</a></p>
<p>The Emscripten way uses Emscripten-Ports. Details can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/compiling/Building-Projects.html">http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/compiling/Building-Projects.html</a></p>
<p>As of this writing, only SDL and SDL_image are available in ports (not SDL_mixer).</p>

<h2 id="amd-graphics-and-steam">AMD Graphics and Steam</h2>
<p>My other PC decided to be a pain.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre having troubles running Steam, you may need to:</p>
<p>‚Äì Switch to the Open Source driver</p>
<p>‚Äì Install Steam updates</p>
<p>‚Äì Switch back to the proprietary driver</p>
<p>You can do this with the ‚Äú<strong>Additional Drivers</strong>‚Äù program.</p>
<p>Open it, wait a moment for it to show up, and do the above.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SauceDriver.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>You can quickly restart the graphics driver by logging out (instead of rebooting).</p>
