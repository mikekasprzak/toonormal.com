This is a story.
Near the end of 2014, I started researching how to makes stuff for Commodore 64. This is something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a very long time. The Commodore was the computer I grew up with as a kid, but as a kid, I only ever wrote some lousy BASIC programs on it. I never made anything that truly utilized the hardware.">

<p>This is a story.</p>
<p>Near the end of 2014, I started researching how to makes stuff for Commodore 64. This is something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a <strong>very</strong> long time. The Commodore was the computer I grew up with as a kid, but as a kid, I only ever wrote some lousy BASIC programs on it. I never made anything that truly utilized the hardware.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe1-VVXIEh4">this video</a>, and there was no turning back.</p>
<p>After figuring out how to get code running on a C64, I decided to set a goal for myself. Since the Commodore was the gaming machine of my youth, I decided: In the final days of 2014, I would create a small game based on something I wanted to make as a kid.</p>
<p>After digging through my sketches, doodles, and notes, I chose to do something with these:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This was me from the early 1990‚Äôs, probably 11 or 12 years old. I used to draw pixel art and game maps on graph paper (I used to paint them on my Commodore 64 too, but I don‚Äôt have backups).</p>
<p>In the 20+ years since then, I‚Äôve learned a thing or two about drawing. I‚Äôm not great, but I have improved. So I decided to re-create the character.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using some of the excellent free tools available for Commodore 64 dev, I made sprites.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a bunch of work, I got this running in an emulator.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Before finally getting it running on an actual Commodore 64.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(NOTE: I stole the SID music file, but it‚Äôs playing for real on the C64)</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there wasn‚Äôt really much of a game there, but I was very proud to have finally make something that ran on the Commodore 64.</p>
<p>Want to hear something interesting? I wasn‚Äôt the only one.</p>
<p>A couple friends on Twitter were also playing with little retro projects.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/rje">Ryan</a> made a game run on the Nintendo Famicom (NES).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/walaber">Tim</a> made a game run on the Atari 2600.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you can see, we were sharing Vines of our progress while we made them. It was pretty cool. üòÄ</p>
<p>I think we might be doing something like this again (I know I am). üôÇ</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Me, for 2015, I‚Äôm planning to dabbling with hardware this year.</p>
<p>Some weeks back I ordered some old sound chips such as the Commodore 64‚Äôs SID (6581), Yamaha YM2612 (Sega Genesis/Mega Drive), and an AY-3 (other). I‚Äôm going to try directly interfacing with those sound chips using either an Arduino or Raspberry Pi (still deciding).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I ordered them via <a href="http://aliexpress.com">AliExpress</a>, which means China, which means shipping can take a month+ to get to me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bringing this story up now, a good month+ in advance, so you too can make preparations.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt a Ludum Dare, or an announcement for a new Game Jam. This is merely an invitation. Maybe you too have a few spare days before the year ends to do something. I usually have a few just after Xmas and Boxing Day, so I‚Äôll be doing something then.</p>
<p>I suggested to the guys that we should come up with a common hashtag (not sure what it should be yet). That way, it‚Äôs easier to find the stuff we‚Äôve been up to. Photos, Videos, Vines.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre welcome to join us. üôÇ</p>
