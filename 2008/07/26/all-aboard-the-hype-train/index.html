  <div class="post-content"><p>August 1st, 2005. Three years ago this Friday. I was a burned out coder that left behind his jobs as Programmer, Senior and Lead Programmer, and eventually Technical Director at various game companies. A dozen handheld, mobile, and console titles to my name. A lifetime of game fascination and experience.</p>
<p>Next, I was starting my own.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not <a href="http://www.bigbluebubble.com/">the</a> <a href="http://www.oceanmedia.hr/">only</a> <a href="http://www.tuskinteractive.com/">one</a> of my former co-workers to do this, and certainly not the <a href="http://www.casuallyhardcore.com/">only</a> one, but I didn’t want to do it the same as we’ve done before. Setting up a studio, hiring a staff, possibly seeking work for hire. No thanks.</p>
<p>As an idealist, naive, and still reasonably young, I wasn’t ready to give up the dream we all have when we get in to games. Make what <strong>I</strong> want, and make a living from it. No publisher’s money looming over my head. No licenses selling on brand recognition alone. No (more) Barbie games.</p>
<p>Despite appearances, I’ve been up to a lot of stuff. <a href="/2008/03/01/engines-names-and-evolution-part-1/">Talked</a> <a href="/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-2/">about</a> <a href="/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-3/">some</a> of them, kept <a href="/2007/02/19/pitch-video-trailer-postmortem/">quiet</a> about others, even mysteriously <a href="/2007/01/30/2d-illustrator-or-animator-needed/">hired a contractor</a> in the midst of it all.</p>
<p>Finally (and actually), the first result is just a week or two away.</p>
<p>Three years.</p>
<p>And <strong>oh boy</strong> is it going to be a disappointment.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But, it <em>finally</em> starts.</p>
