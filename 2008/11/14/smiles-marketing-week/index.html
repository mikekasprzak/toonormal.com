<p>The rest of the Think Services network picked up on the <a href="http://fingergaming.com/2008/11/smiles/">FingerGaming</a> review as part of the usual syndication.</p>

<p>And continuing with Think Services, I entered the game in the <a href="http://www.igfmobile.com">IGF Mobile</a>.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>Phil Hassey did me a huge favor promoting me to his mailing list and the Galcon community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.galcon.com/other/smiles/?action=pov">http://www.galcon.com/other/smiles/</a></p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>The rest was all up to me.</p>
<p>I contacted pretty much every iPhone gaming site, and a few non gaming ones. Several sites seemed to ignore me, but I was pleased to get some positive feedback right in the e-mails. It does look like you wont be seeing me show anywhere up until next week though.</p>
<p>As a result of the direct contact, I also got to do an interview. The questions were a set of stock questions, but still. Out of all my years working on games, it was actually my first time being interviewed. So <strong>I</strong> think it’s cool.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I’ll link the interview once it goes live.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>I also sent out a press release.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/42100/Sykhronics-grins-on-to-iPhone-with-Smiles">MCV</a> | <a href="http://www.developmag.com/press-releases/42100/Sykhronics-grins-on-to-iPhone-with-Smiles">Develop</a> | <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/smiles-two-cheery-puzzle-games-in-one-iphone-download">GamesIndustry.biz</a></p>
<p>You can read it’s contents in my previous post. But as I learned in my comments, it seems I should have hit up the #ludumdare crew for some feedback first.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Furthermore, I tried to notify the mainstream gaming press/blogs. I don’t think I got much traction though, but I did my video on GameTrailers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42626.html">http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42626.html</a></p>
<p>Haha, it’s been so long. I miss the vicious criticism of the mainstream gaming public.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Remember, I’m the guy that used to work on girl games.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>I finally updated the Sykhronics website. Not in any significant fashion, but it now suggests my industry cred and has a real e-mail link.</p>

<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s all I have to show at this point.</p>
<p>I’d like to sales have been good, but as I’ve been discovering it’s incredibly difficult to be seen outside (and in) the App Store. I certainly have no shortage of plans to continue the promotion, but if you’re going to make a decent income with a somewhat casual game, you <em>really</em> need Apple’s support.</p>
<p>I’m going to <strong><em>try</em></strong> and pull together a post like this each week, detailing what went in to the development of Smiles. I’ll be busy with Smiles related things for the rest of the year, so this should give me a nice break. Once Smiles is out of the system, we’ll get back to your regularly scheduled game and physicsy game crayzness. There’s some weird physics stuff in Smiles too, but that’s a post in and of itself.</p>
<p>Now I’m off to order some computer parts, so I can fix a dying workstation and server.</p>
