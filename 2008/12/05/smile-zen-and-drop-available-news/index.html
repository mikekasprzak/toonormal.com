<p>As the topic suggests, <strong>Smiles Drop</strong> and <strong>Smiles Zen</strong> are now both available. <strong>$2.99</strong> each, or save <strong>$1</strong> by getting <strong>Smiles</strong> (<strong>$4.99</strong>).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.smiles-game.com/SmilesZen2.png" alt=""> <img src="http://www.smiles-game.com/SmilesDrop2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out.  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>As for blog content, I&rsquo;m half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days&hellip; and I sorta haven&rsquo;t gone back to finish the post yet.  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I sent a bunch of e-mails out late Monday night to announce the full availability of <em>the split</em>. I got some response. I&rsquo;ll list these later with the new reviews.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, I should be contributing a chapter to a book. More details to follow in the coming months.</p>
<p>As for the last week and the weekend, I&rsquo;ve been busy backing up, formatting, rebuilding my server and workstation PC&rsquo;s. Server&rsquo;s back up and humming away (short an SVN problem). Workstation&hellip; heh&hellip; I guess that&rsquo;s in progress. It&rsquo;s backed up, but I keep putting off the format.</p>
<p>Main reason for putting it off, Ludum Dare 13.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare 13</a> is this weekend. Theme voting is on right now. Then at the usual 11 PM EST it goes live, and 48 hours later you have a game. This is the first one in a long time I&rsquo;m making the effort to enter. Things have “sort of” calmed down. At least, calm enough that I&rsquo;m able to make such plans. Heh, one of these days I&rsquo;ll get around to finishing the site.  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>In related <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> news, we&rsquo;re obviously all a little silly. <a href="http://www.towlr.com">Towlr</a> is back and bigger than ever.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/TowlrFourSmall.png" alt=""></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.towlr.com">www.towlr.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Currently there are 4 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->towlr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> games created by different Ludum Dare regulars featured on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->official site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. More are in development and/or require some py2exe love. If there ever was a Ludum Dare inside joke/critique on game design, it&rsquo;s this. Towlr is watching. Towlr waits. May you discover the cake in each.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IGF Mobile entries list<!-- raw HTML omitted --> went live the other day. A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->relieved<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mere 104 entries. Hehe, with my entry number of 754, I was a little worried. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phil<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I are both there, as well as several people I&rsquo;ve been chatting with via e-mail, forums, IRC and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Plus, as far as I can tell, each category of a classic IGF is available too so&hellip; dare I say&hellip; there&rsquo;s actually a chance of being a finalist for something. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been marketing like a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->machine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Tuesday night, Apple went live with a feature that lets you send promotional codes good for a free copy of games. They limit you to 50 codes per game, and with 3 games worth of codes at my disposal I&rsquo;ve been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->getting creative<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/iphone-app-promo-code.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This image I lifted from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an article on iLounge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It seems I was aggressive enough to get a mention. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve nearly used up all my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smiles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> freebies. I&rsquo;m saving a few for emergencies, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smiles Zen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smiles Drop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> codes have proved to be good giveaways for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone game sites<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->little<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->promotion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I did today was met with some pretty good response. One and two minutes later, and the codes were all gone.</p>
<p>Googling for “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smiles Game<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” and “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smile iPhone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” now finally yields some results related to the game. Excellent. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""> . Cracking the “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smiles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” search term is going to be a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> battle. Bottom of page 9 last I checked. I just have to keep people talking. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>Now for the latest reviews!</p>
<p>First off, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Smiles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is currently averaging a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.8 Star<!-- raw HTML omitted --> user rating worldwide. That&rsquo;s pretty great. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->OSX Reality<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gave Smiles a nice <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 Star<!-- raw HTML omitted --> review. The only beef was likely solved with the recent release of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the split<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone Games Network<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gave Smiles <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.5 Stars<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an Editors&rsquo; Choice award, and a great quote for the website.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->148 Apps<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gave Smiles <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.5 Stars<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and another great quote for the website.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bwana.tv<!-- raw HTML omitted --> approves of Smiles in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Video Review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A shame he didn&rsquo;t find the multiple touches feature in Drop yet. I need to make this more obvious in v1.1.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A blogger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> discovered Smiles, and seems to think it&rsquo;s worth the money. That&rsquo;s good. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>And the publicity!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slide to Play<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mentioned Smiles in their weekly look at games video.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->iLounge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> included a mention in addition to the promo codes article above.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The iPhone Blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> liked my alternative to the usual price drop madness plaguing the iPhone.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket Gamer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> liked it enough to post about it too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to skip syndication this time, since there&rsquo;s so much of it. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>So wow, lots going on. I know I&rsquo;ve missed something, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got for now.</p>
<p>In the mean time, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ludum Dare 13<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll be all over that and then some. Then to finish (start) this workstation format, and get back to the fun.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>
