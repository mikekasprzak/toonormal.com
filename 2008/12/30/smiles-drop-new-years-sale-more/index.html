So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab Smiles Drop for the extremely reasonable price of $1.99 (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy Smiles Zen after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on Smiles. Well… you might save a penny buying separately, but still.">

<p>So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab <strong>Smiles Drop</strong> for the extremely reasonable price of <strong>$1.99</strong> (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy <strong>Smiles Zen</strong> after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on <strong>Smiles</strong>. Well… you might save a penny buying separately, but still.</p>

<p>Working on an update for Smiles too. Should include a battery save feature, that should improve battery life for a lower framerate. Fun fun.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>Smiles’ art was featured in a nonstandard place. In an article on game art.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/art/features/CoderGameArt/">http://www.gamedev.net/reference/art/features/CoderGameArt/</a></p>
<p>Awesome. 😀</p>
<p>The article is about how a programmer can cheat to make decent game art, though Smiles is referenced as <em>a good example</em> of shape.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>In other news… yeah… I guess the default theme has hung around for a while longer than expected. One of these days I’ll make something cool and slap it on the top… followed by fattening up the theme a bit.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been playing around with a new digital painting app, <a href="http://sai.detstwo.com/sai/index">Paint Tool Sai</a>. As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_Shop_Pro">Paint Shop Pro</a> user (hoping to find a replacement), I have to say the toolset is extremely familiar. It lacks font features so it’s no replacement for PSP, but the <strong>workflow is incredible</strong>. It’s possible I may stop using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_SketchBook_Pro">Sketchbook Pro</a> and start using this in it’s stead.</p>
<p>Slight language barrier, but I think I love it.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/saiinterface.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I’ll have more to say about Paint Tool Sai as I put it in to production.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>Also writing. Yes, writing. Just not writing blog stuff it seems.</p>
<p>– – – – – – –</p>
<p>I’ll leave you with a teaser… since I want to try out the upload feature.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/clawwalls_look.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Not a project per se, but proof that I’m exploring ideas. Well, more than anything, proof that I’m playing with Blender again. Figuring out how you’d make 3D tiles… for backgrounds of course. I still have to do 2D characters. That’s just the way I am. 🙂</p>
