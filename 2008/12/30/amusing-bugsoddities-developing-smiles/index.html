Here’s what it was supposed to look like. Cool looking, but the problem with this was the effect would make you queasy.">

<p>In the end I had to tone this down. It’s still in the game, but very subtle now. Not a good idea to make your customers get sick.</p>
<p>The next bug is a little more minor. I was building my menu screens, and gave some elements the same ID as one of my buttons.</p>

<p>The last one is just me being silly. Working on the achievement unlocked effect, I decided the achievements should have a conversation with themselves.</p>
