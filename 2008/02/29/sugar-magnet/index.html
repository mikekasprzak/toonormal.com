  <div class="post-content"><p>February 29th! How could I <em>not</em> say something today.</p>
<p>Just what to say is the question.</p>
<p>Blogging in the past, I&rsquo;ve noticed the tendency to want to turn the blog <em>in to something</em>. A community, articles and subjects, talk-back, and all that stuff. And that&rsquo;s great and all, but it&rsquo;s a lot of work for not much return. Traditionally to make ends meet this way, you plaster your blog with advertisements, or actively soliciting contract work. No thanks.</p>
<p>Any readership I may have either hits me once a month, or watches me via RSS or an aggregator. And hey, that&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;m impressed that I have a readership  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="">. A project shrouded in half-ass secrecy isn&rsquo;t great content. Pulling away the curtain entirely isn&rsquo;t easy to do, at least until the perpetual “later”. So instead, this blog collects occasional rants and the odd picture.</p>
<p>Exciting.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ready to promise a change or anything, but I have a bit of a multi-part rant brewed. I&rsquo;ve been putting a lot of serious thought and planning in to my next project, and in several ways it&rsquo;s already started. I want it to be blogged right and from the beginning. That just happens to mean I start now.</p>
<p>So tomorrow, March 1st, I&rsquo;ll be <em>at least</em> posting part one. I&rsquo;m not delay it for suspense or anything. The rant I&rsquo;m staring at is long, technical, and self referential. The type of rant that&rsquo;s really been holding me back from having more to talk about. For cohesions sake, I just want to sleep on it to be sure it all sounds right. It&rsquo;s looking like it&rsquo;ll be between 3 and 5 parts long.</p>
<p>Then, in theory, I can finally start talking in the present. Wow!</p>
<p>I want to start walking through my thought process of architecting “<em>the next</em>“. Where I&rsquo;ve made mistakes, and so on.</p>
<p>Heavy technical, just like mom used to make.</p>
