  <div class="post-content"><p>Wow, it&rsquo;s been so long.</p>
<p>The last game I did TRC for was Atomic Betty, the Gameboy Advance game I worked on before leaving Big Blue Bubble. That would have been some time during July of 2005. That finished up, and I was a free man for August 1st.</p>
<p>By TRC I mean <em>Technical Requirements Checklist</em>. Every platform holder has them, though they sometimes have a different name for them. A TRC is a combination of guidelines. Terms to use do identify aspects of the target platform, or the brand. Generally speaking, it&rsquo;s everything you have to do to be officially allowed on a system.</p>
<p>The TRC process also includes requirements necessary for submission. How to package things up, naming conventions to use for files, and so on.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s TRC is interesting. It&rsquo;s not as explicit as saying refer to the d-pad as the directional pad, but it&rsquo;s more a collection of user interface and aesthetic design guidelines. After all, it&rsquo;s a system without buttons*.  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Apple does have separate guides for name, logo, image, and trademark usage, as well as standard submission procedures. But it&rsquo;s refreshing to be met with guidelines that encourage a streamlining of the user experience.</p>
<p>A perfect historic example, it&rsquo;s a TRC requirement that every 3rd party title must display “Licensed by Nintendo” on the first screen you see. It&rsquo;s the continued legacy of the so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Seal_of_Quality">Nintendo Seal of Quality</a>, as well as protecting them from liability. Even though you&rsquo;re greeted with is the Nintendo logo on the original Gameboy, your relationship with Nintendo still must be made explicit.</p>
<p>Then that&rsquo;s usually followed by half a dozen screens letting you know who paid for the game, what brands were licensed, and finally who made it before bringing up the title screen.</p>
<p>Not a problem per se, but Apple strongly encourages you to do away with this time wasting legacy. Like a “google.com” of a mobile interface. Right to the point.</p>
<p>– – – – –</p>
<p>My point finally is the timing. TRC comes at the end of the project. It&rsquo;s how you really tell the project is finally finishing. Making terminology corrections, digging through documents making sure you&rsquo;re 100% to spec. Sure, it&rsquo;s one more thing on a long list of things needed to finish a game. But what&rsquo;s not to love about being done?</p>
<p>Early in my “career”, I always got the impression from friends and colleagues that the TRC was some sort of painfully horrible task, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve had my moments with them as well. But seeing how long it&rsquo;s been from when I thought I was nearly done to now, I&rsquo;ve been chasing TRC time for weeks and months. And it&rsquo;s certainly a much better product as a result.</p>
<p>Potential sales, oh who knows. The weirdness seen watching the marketplace is topic all in itself. Might ‘break even&rsquo;, might not. But I&rsquo;m happy with the product. It&rsquo;s everything I&rsquo;d want in such a game.</p>
<p>Outside of some final testing, all I have left is the submission material. A text blurb for the store, some screen shots, an icon, and a large promotional graphic. That actually a piece of art I still need to create. I made sketches and roughs a few weeks ago, but never got around to coloring a final image. In this age of digital downloads, it&rsquo;s the closest thing to box art.</p>
<p>A gameplay video isn&rsquo;t an Apple requirement, but everybody does it anyways. You&rsquo;ll have to give me a couple days for that. When that&rsquo;s done, you&rsquo;ll see it here first.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m up to. Testing, and promotional artwork.</p>
