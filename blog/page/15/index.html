    <h2>Nook and Emscripten: A technical look at C&#43;&#43; GameDev in the Browser</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I run an online game-jam event called Ludum Dare, and this past weekend I got together with a friend (Derek Laufman of Halfbot) and we made a game. What did we make? A platformer about size.
The game was created over a period 72 hours. Somehow, amazing to me, we managed to pull it together despite our responsibilities.
 Me running the event (Ludum Dare) Family gathering at my brothers I attended on the Saturday Car appointment on Monday Derek taking care of his baby  Fortunately, running Ludum Dare is only busy for me before the event, and at submission time (two of them, 3-5 hours each). During the event I‚Äôm free to sit down and do whatever I want. This weekend was the Diablo 3 beta test, and if I was a lesser man, I‚Äôd have played that. Fortunately for me, Derek came to me a couple weeks ago and suggested we make a game together, I said yes, and the rest is history.
It‚Äôs totally silly, but I‚Äôm actually proud of the fact that I managed to attend the family gathering and the car appointment. Stupid me, I could have actually cancelled/rescheduled the appointment for Tuesday or Wednesday, but I decided to go ahead with it anyway. The car appointment was my yearly service for my smartcar, and I ended up staying in the neighborhood of the dealership for about 5 hours of that day. Working on my Ludum Dare game on my laptop, I had WIFI at the dealership, and also McDonalds, where I parked myself for a couple hours. To be honest, this was probably the first time I seriously ‚ÄúCoffee Shop Developed‚Äù, and where I actually got some serious work done. It was fun, because it was out of the ordinary. üôÇ
Anyways, that‚Äôs enough back story. Lets get nerdy.

    <p>Hello! This is quite possibly the last post I‚Äôll do in 2011, so lets make with the goods!
This past week I‚Äôve continued working on the demake of my primary project. If you checked out the Ludum Dare prototype, the core mechanics have dramatically improved since then (about 4 days ago).
I actually keep a relatively detailed development Journal while working, but a lot of stuff is either very minor, subtle, contains spoilers, or is simply just too long to post....</p>

    <p>I wont talk too much about how Ludum Dare itself went, as I‚Äôve already done that over here.
But in addition to running the event, I participated for the first time in a long time. The theme was ‚ÄúAlone‚Äú, which I find funny given the title of my game. Could I not enter? üòâ
About a week before Ludum Dare, I started toying with the idea of creating a demake of my game....</p>

    <h2>A Better MinGW &#43; MSys Shell</h2>

  <div class="entry-meta">
    <time>December 4, 2011</time>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Pekka posed a good question recently that got me thinking: The default Bash shell that comes with MinGW (MSys) kinda sucks. You can‚Äôt resize the Window, selections are this odd visible only thing, in essence: it works like an ordinary windows cmd shell.
The solution is surprisingly straight forward: Use MinTTY.
Open up a MinGW shell, and do the following:
 mingw-get install mintty
 A few moments later, you‚Äôll have MinTTY installed....</p>

    <h2>BlackBerry PlayBook NDK Command Line Advanced Quickstart Guide</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Phil keeps telling me I need to document what I do. After all, I‚Äôve worked on a ridiculous number of platforms, and with many SDK‚Äôs.
So alright, I‚Äôm going to record and share my notes here. I‚Äôm going to assume you have your own build system figured out, and cover the highlights and key things you need to know and do to get native code up and running on the PlayBook.
Device Summary Just a few highlights about the platform.
 Dual Core 1 GHz ARM Coretex-A9 w/ Neon, 7‚Ä≥ 1024√ó600 IPS LCD (drool), PowerVR SGX 540 GPU NDK Available. Work either through a custom Eclipse IDE, or entirely from the command line Command line is a typical GCC cross compiler setup, with custom tools for packaging/deploying Linux-like platform. EGL and GLES1/GLES2 available. OpenAL available (Notes) BlackBerry packages are BAR files, which are actually JAR files, which are actually ZIP files Was on sale for just $199 during the weeks surrounding ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù.  Step 1. Request Signing Keys This is step 1 because how long it takes is entirely outside your control.
Go to http://developer.blackberry.com/native/signingkey (ALT) and make your request. Typically within a few hours you will get a series of e-mails containing .csj files, so if you‚Äôve previously downloaded the SDK, you‚Äôll be waiting a while before you can test on device. More details here.
IMPORTANT: REMEMBER YOUR PIN AND COMPANY NAME! YOU WILL NEED IT!
For times like these, I like to create a text file containing the signing code, and put it alongside the signing keys. Yes, technically that partially defeats the security purpose of the keys, but keys and signing is usually such-a-pain.
Step 1b. Apply for a Blackberry AppWorld Vendor account This also takes a while, so do this early to get in the queue sooner.
https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/
You will eventually get an email asking for a scan of government issued ID such as a drivers license, or business related documents (to prove you are real). If you have these ready, you can respond to the request quickly.
Payments are via Paypal, so you will need a valid Paypal account to be paid.
Step 2. Get the NDK Yeah! You can do it! Click them links and go go go!
https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/
Notably, the downloader tries to install some Akamai service thingy. I couldn‚Äôt get this working, but that‚Äôs okay. There‚Äôs an option to say ‚Äúthis did not work‚Äù in the popup box, and after the popup closes there‚Äôs an option to download directly without Akamai. Use it.

    <p>Enough of this non-game talk.
The past month has been extremely good for progress. I did not meet my goal for the month, but I‚Äôd be silly to complain. Yadda yadda ya.
Against my better judgement, I‚Äôm going to stop beating around the bush and show you:
 That‚Äôs cool Mike, but what is it?
 Tech.
 Wait Mike, you could have done that in a day using Unity? It would be faster!...</p>

    <p>NAS time, again! Like before, I‚Äôm collecting my notes and thoughts all in one place.
Two months later As mentioned in my earlier posts, I‚Äôm running both SVN and AppDailySales on it (iTunes Connect Sales Stat grabber). In addition, I‚Äôve been running an internal wiki on it. I used to host 2 different external wikis, but both have been imported and archived locally.
I chose DokuWiki for my internal wiki because it uses flat files, meaning I don‚Äôt have to run SQL (though it is just a button to enable MySQL on the Synology)....</p>
