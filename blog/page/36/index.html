    <h2>May Round-Up, and my last</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The round up for may is up. Heh, I’m sure I’m going to be scolded by Mike and Seth for not finding time to mention to them that this would be my last round up, but in a way, that’s half the reason why. Busy busy.
A hand full of interesting games this month. Eets, the TIM like game with the hungry mood swing guy; Bone: The Great Cow Race, a fine modern example of comic gone adventure game; Odyssey: Winds of Athena, the game with the water currents gameplay; and American History Lux, desensitizing gamers of war since 1754....</p>

    <h2>April Round Up-Up</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yup, I’m a few days behind mentioning this, but this month’s round up is up. A personal favorite of mine, Titan Attacks reigned supreme, followed by the slick steam powered airship game, Steam Brigade, and the un-noted but equally as surprisingly quality Inlay clone, Mosaic: Tomb of Mystery. Fun stuff.
As expected, I’m going to say things are going well with the game, despite the updates. Actually, better than well. Much Biz oriented stuff, which I’m going to have to sit on for a while....</p>

    <h2>How to annoy the Internet</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>A condensed version of my previous post seemed to be making the rounds. It’s resulted in several interesting comments and additions from developers and gamers alike. I’ve decided to do your homework, and compile this list. Text in bold are the originals, with my comments in normal type.
Here we go.

    <h2>8 ways to annoy the panel</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Now that I’ve succeeded in world domination (also known as syndication), I present to you a short list of complaints to fellow developers. 8 ways to make the monthly round-up panel hate you. Unofficial in every way, as it’s just my observations, but toned a tad sarcastic and sharp to get the point across. It’s not for everyone, as we do get a good number of games that work great. But there’s just enough of them to compel me to write this....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So, that’s what happens on the 91’st day of the year shows up, your name is Mike, and you want to poke fun at casual gaming. You end up with a human body themed match 3, and an outrageous story that I don’t even want to rationalize. And yes, all Mike’s were thinking the exact same thing.
Yeah, this post is a rather plain one. Just a confirmation that yes, that was a joke, and an excuse to do an image dump....</p>

    <h2>March Progress Grande</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>With mere minutes left before the end of the month (and April fools), I guess now is as good of a time as ever to do an update… At least before someone thinks I’m joking.
Content was put aside earlier in the month, as we finish and fix more important things. Besides, having working tools before we start building anything would make more sense. Speaking of tools…
The Object and Map Editors are functional and working great....</p>

    <h2>Thursday Morning GDC 2k6</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Thursday, another big day at the Game Developers Conference.
Yesterday had some good events. The IGF results were announced, and the evil forces of Darwinia ran away with most of the prize money. Curse you Darwinia, I will have my revenge! Sony also spilled the beans, announcing a service “like” Xbox Live Arcade, but neglects to invite Indie’s. How rude. And everyone’s talking about Duke Nukem Forever 2.
It’ll be tough to beat a day as grand as yesterday, but today is always looking for a challenge....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yep, it’s that time of month. Tell me, what’s round, monthly and up? I shouldn’t have to answer that question.
A pretty light month. A slick little Final Fantasy’esc RPG, Aveyond. An adventure game with this big blue thing and a really long name, Frasse and the Peas of Kekick. Yes, that’s right. An undersea adventure, Joust revisited, a card game, and more at the Tunnel.
Yeah, I’ve been quieter than I had hoped....</p>
