    <h2>C&#43;&#43;11 Compiler Support Wishlist</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>A few months back I did this little investigation in to C&#43;&#43;11 support across compilers. The goal here was to figure out what C&#43;&#43;11 features I could safely use today. I also ended up creating a useful list of compiler versions sorted by platform. I will continue, at least for the near term, updating this list as I see changes.
This post is a follow up to that. I’m more familiar now with the actual use of many of these ‘nextgen’ features, so this post is a brief on certain features I really want to use, and why I can or can not use them.

    <h2>Safe C&#43;&#43; Pointers to Member Functions (Functors)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I did a post some time ago on a threading library called TinyThread&#43;&#43;. You can find it here.
Like always, the following is just a collection of notes.
Item 1: TinyThread&#43;&#43; is an almost functionally equivalent alternative to C&#43;&#43;11 threads, but instead of taking multiple arguments to the thread it takes a single void*. When C&#43;&#43;11 support improves everywhere, that will be the time to switch. But in the meantime, a void* is a good compromise.
Item 2: Whenever I describe how and why a member function is different than a global/static function, I often say that a member function has a “secret 1st argument, the ‘this’ pointer”. Heck, if I was going to build a C&#43;&#43; compiler, I would implement it like this. So for the longest time I just assumed this is how others implemented it.
If this is true, then it should be possible to convert a member function in to a “void Func(void*)”.
* * *
Long story short, this behavior is forbidden by the C&#43;&#43; standard. That said, it works in GCC, but fails in MSVC. In GCC’s case, while it does work, it invokes a warning known as “pmf-conversions”. You can explicitly disable the warning with “-Wno-pmf-conversions”, but given that this just doesn’t work in Visual Studio it’s probably unwise to do in the first place.
My nice solution was to add a static proxy function that takes a single “this class” pointer, and call the function as if it was a member of the class (because it is).

    <h2>Net Adapter &amp;#8211; AKA the &amp;#8220;Get IP/MAC address&amp;#8221; library</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So hey. I wrote and open sourced a small cross platform library for getting the IP and MAC address of the current device. You can find it here:
https://github.com/povrazor/net-adapter
So far I’ve tested it on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and Mac OSX Mountain Lion. It *should* also work on iOS, BSD and Android. If you happen to test it on one of those other platforms, I would love to know what the Sample program outputs....</p>

    <h2>HTTP GET and POST&amp;#8217;s from scratch with Sockets</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So I’ve done a bunch of networking research lately, and have actually decided I’m not going to continue writing my own HTTP GETter and POSTer. Instead, I’ll be using libcurl. That said, I am not that comfortable using 3rd party libraries and tools unless I have a solid understanding of how they work internally.
So this is a collection of notes on how to do HTTP GET and POST requests, in case I ever need to come back and do this from scratch (because I’m not going to remember all this)....</p>

    <h2>Cross Platform C&#43;&#43; Threading Today</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>C&#43;&#43;11 finally brings threading in to the core C&#43;&#43; language. Unfortunately, as my little investigation found, we’re not quite all there yet.
That’s okay though, ’cause as it turns out, most of core function of C&#43;&#43; threading can be emulated using standard C and C&#43;&#43; features. While doing something else, I stumbled upon a library TinyThread&#43;&#43;. It’s lightweight (2&#43;1 source files), cross platform, and free&#43;open source in the best ways possible.
http://tinythreadpp.bitsnbites.eu/
TinyThread&#43;&#43; attempts to emulate the usage of standard C&#43;&#43;11 threading, in a decent, good enough, compromise way. I like it, so instead of fooling around with pThreads and whatever classic Microsoft APIs do, I’m going to use it. And since it’s so simple (2&#43;1 files), if I need something or need to fix something, it’s right there. Great.
Alternatively, there is an equivalent C variant: http://tinycthread.bitsnbites.eu/

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So it’s Ludum Dare 24 weekend (Aug 24th), and I’m finally catching up on some work I had to put off as I … ahem … attended to my duties. Now that the event is going strong, it’s reading time!
The main thing I need to do is some Windows 8 research. I installed the Windows 8 RTM (release) Trial on a new machine earlier this week, as well as the Visual Studio 2012 Express....</p>

    <h2>Something new, blue, and not for you</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So, I’ve been dabbling with something new.
One of the frustrating conclusions I came to whilst working on “Alone, The” was that content creation was way, far far, too much work. I went in to the project with some strong ideals about procedural content being lifeless and uninteresting. I still somewhat believe that, but when reality kicks in, you realize one can not make a seriously large game alone at a decent pace without being somewhat procedural....</p>
