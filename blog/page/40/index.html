    <p>The round up is here. Hurah.
An underwater sequel to Cosmo Bots, a mech 3D shooter War World, Diablo meets Gauntlet in Evil Invasion, and a double dose of cavemen. An alright month. We’ve had better.
But wait! What is this? Bright red, black, orange and blue banners? Oh noes! What could this be? An add campaign for some wacky game? Inconceivable!...</p>

    <h2>Balloon Dynamics</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-meta">
    <time>September 21, 2005</time>
  </div>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Alright, this was inspired from a game idea I had a few years ago. In the midst of working on my new physics engine, I’ve decided to revisit the idea and noticed an oddity in my design. Balloons.
Balloons are interesting. Unlike most objects in a game situation, they have this odd property of opposing gravity and going up. With that alone, we can do a convincing simulation in a game by consistently giving it an upward force larger than gravity....</p>

    <h2>IGF and PuffBOMB clones?</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-meta">

  </div>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Well, well. The IGF 2006 Entries are now online, and we have a PuffBOMB clone to duel with. Impulse. It appers to be, according to the description, pretty much the same idea. Lets quote.
 Impulse: The player must place bombs and adjust their timers to make a ball hit the goal field. Obstacles, special elements and force fields provide varied levels. An interactive timeline helps controlling the game by jumping to specific times and guarantees a flexible and unique gameplay....</p>

    <p>Hurah! Finally open. Welcome. Come on in and hear me think.
At some point throughout the day I was working. Really, I was; You can trust me. My new (3rd) office whiteboard just arrived this morning. I took the liberty of violating it with some math/physics filth. It seems to be holding up well, which is good, as I expect many more shamefull acts of mathematics to be performed on it....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Alright, we’ve got a nice backlog of posts to make this blog look meaningful now. I’ll quickly spruce up the logo, and sneak off to some magical forums claiming “Oh! Didn’t I tell you, I have a blog too! I can’t believe it never came up in conversation. Har Har Har”. Yes, it will be brilliant.
A new round up should be on the Tunnel soon. Russell was down in TV land promoting the site on Attack of the Show....</p>

  <div class="entry-meta">

  </div>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Apparently I forgot about this. The Slamdance Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition is yet another IGF like compo. I don’t think it’s actually worth any prizes… at least none their publicizing. Either way, I’ve put together a publicity pack for them, and will be sending it off today. A shame that they’re making me pay to enter. Buh.
I think what turned me off about this “way back when” was that the game had to be profitless, but apparently that’s not the case anymore....</p>

    <h2>IGF, 117?</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-meta">
    <time>September 7, 2005</time>
  </div>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Oh wow, the IGF is getting serious now. A news report on Gamasutra suggested that the IGF hit a record entry high of 117… Which is… many.
Like the dork I am, I’ll be monitoring this stuff. Don’t think this’ll be the last of my IGF rantings, oh no! Mwahaha!
Oh, and I’ve aparently become a big fan of incorrectly linking the IGF. Instead, I’ve found myself linking an equally prestigious organization, The Royal Society for the Relief of Indigent Gentlewomen of Scotland (Fund)....</p>

    <p>Hmm, it seems I misplaced this blog post.
With less than 5 hours to spare, it’s in. Excellent. It wasn’t without it’s drama though. Once confirmed by myself, my brother, and a few friends that everything was good, I began to upload. *OH GOOD*, the upload server was acting up! Ack!
Within 20 minutes things cleared up. I snuck my game into it’s folder, hit the switch, and waited as it’s bytes were sucked out of Canada into some server likely in the California area....</p>

    <p>Clock is ticking.
Yep. In one sense, I’m ready to go. I filled out the submission for yesterday, and paid my entry fee. Apparently however, you need an installer. *Oh*. So today, after finishing the missing graphics, I got to do that. Huge thanks to Seth for sharing with me his NSIS script, which saved me hours of digging for little things like uninstaller cleanlyness, icon changing, and so many silly little things....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So begins the campaign. PuffBOMB.com/.net/.org are now online with this wonderful tease site. I’ll have banners show up in the indie world soon, just to build some awareness. I have some big plans for this game.
IGF polishing goes well. Just a few more graphics, and some minor updates to the game itself, and we’re good to go.
2 days left. We’re looking good....</p>
