    <h2>Visual Studio projects for GCC/MinGW/Xcode coders</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the things on my blogging TODO list is to show how I work. Many coders find it odd to hear that I work on Windows without Visual Studio, or that I work on the Mac by rarely touching the Mac. Just me, a text editor (a good one), and a bunch of useful scripting.
In my current project though (Smiles PC), I‚Äôve run in to a slight brick wall that requires me and my development arch nemesis to join forces. It‚Äôs almost funny, but it‚Äôs been about 10 years since I‚Äôve had to touch a Microsoft compiler. Normally I‚Äôd be reluctant, but we‚Äôre talking a distribution issue here‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs how I get paid. üòâ
So, today‚Äôs when I swallow my command line pride and get Smiles building with Visual Studio.
This post is long, nuanced, technical, and mostly for my own benefit. So if you‚Äôre up for an over analysis of Windows Developers favorite development tool, hit the link.

    <h2>Ludum Dare 16 Announcement</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-meta">

  </div>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Today we announced the date for Ludum Dare #16. This upcoming December 11th-13th weekend.
Ludum Dare is that other thing I do. Along with Phil, Mike and Seth, we run a community website based around the infamous Ludum Dare competition. Game developers from around the world assemble, pick a theme, and make a game from scratch over the weekend. Then we vote on our favorites.
http://www.ludumdare.com/‚Ä¶/announcing-ludum-dare-16-december-11th-13th-weekend/
Nowadays, we do it 3 times per year, this one being our regular December competition....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This is not what I‚Äôve been up to all year, but it is what I‚Äôm up to right now.
So, let‚Äôs introduce the project.
Officially, the project is named Smiles. Specifically though, the project‚Äôs working title is Smiles PC. Just as you‚Äôd expect, it‚Äôs Smiles the iPhone game for PC, Mac and Linux. Actually it‚Äôs more than that, but lets stick with this for now.
At it‚Äôs core, Smiles PC is about removing the dependencies of the iPhone from the game....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>As planned, Smiles Zen 1.3 and Smiles Drop 1.3 were sent late Friday night (technically 5 AM the next day). I made the mentioned addition of arrows after discovering some people didn‚Äôt realize you could click on the icon. Here‚Äôs a snap of that from the iPhone build on the PC.
Cross promotion, now with arrows!
I had some friends look at this screen, and got a good reaction from the ‚Äúlove hearts‚Äù, so I made a similar change to free version....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Here‚Äôs something I hope to start doing more often. Technically, I‚Äôve been hoping to actually start all year. Short development video logs.
Today‚Äôs video is a demonstration of the cross promotion features in Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop. Inspiration hit last night, and I added something amusing to it I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd share.
Both builds should go out tonight. I‚Äôll be adding a pair of arrows beside the icon, just so it‚Äôs even clearer that you can click on it right here....</p>

    <p>Smiles 1.3 is already in the Apple queue, but not Zen and Drop yet. Something ‚Äúnew‚Äù in 1.3 is that I removed the ‚Äúhow to play music‚Äù instructions from the game. This used to be in the upper right corner of the screen. The description used to say you could ‚Äúdouble tap‚Äù the home button to bring up music playback, but it seems that was wrong on the iPhones and 3rd gen iPods....</p>

    <p>Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the launch of Smiles.
‚Ä¶
Yeah, it‚Äôs been that long already.
This weekend I‚Äôm giving Smiles Zen away for FREE. Also, I‚Äôve discounting Smiles to $1.99 to reflect the price. I guess that‚Äôs how we celebrate 1 year on iPhone. üòâ
In other news, Smiles 1.3 is on the way. I discovered a graphics performance bug on the newer iPhones and iPods (SGX), so that is now fixed....</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm in the middle of‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ an insane amount of stuff. The WordPress update botched my layout (forgot to copy the default theme), so I decided to break it even more. üôÇ
I‚Äôll be writing up a full feature/retrospective for Ludum Dare 15 likely today. Results are up, and we‚Äôve got some bragging to do. üôÇ
I also have a big announcement to make soon (in a few weeks, month or so)....</p>

    <p>Wow!
Ludum Dare #14‚Äôs 123 entries in April was a pretty big deal, but our 15th Ludum Dare in August did a whopping 144! Yikes!
http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview
On the plus side, Phil and I came together and awesome-ified the website. He wrote our all new voting and submission system, and I made the site look new and purty. And when all was said and done, it actually worked! Wow!
It came together the weekend before the competition....</p>
