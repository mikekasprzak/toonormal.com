      <description>This is a collection of notes from a server migration.
New Machine Setup The destination server now runs Ubuntu 20.04. Some initial setup stuff.
# add a sudo user adduser cooldude usermod -aG sudo cooldude # name the machine (instead of editing /etc/hostname) hostnamectl set-hostname servername # you should add `servername` to the /etc/hosts file # (mainly so you can refer to the local machine by name) # generate an ssh key (I need to ssh in to another machine so) ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 # enable firewall ufw allow 22 ufw allow http ufw allow https ufw enable # install updates apt update apt upgrade # HEY!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started reading the ancient little book on writing. I eventually attacked the book with a highlighter, but I know I will forget some of my thought, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take notes.
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to say it, but if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to gleen what&amp;rsquo;s in the book by reading this, don&amp;rsquo;t bother. Go buy the book. It&amp;rsquo;s $10 brand new.

      <title>Notes: Creating Live OBS Motion Graphics in HTML5</title>

      <description>This is early, but here are a collection of thoughts when it comes to creating motion graphics for OBS.
OBS Browser source plugin Our ability to make live motion graphics that move and even use live data is made possible thanks to the OBS Browser plugin. The plugin ships with the Windows/Mac version of OBS, but the original repo is an important reference.
 Windows, Mac: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-browser Linux: https://github.com/bazukas/obs-linuxbrowser  I have not done much testing with Linux yet, but in quick tests it was working.</description>

      <description>This is a deep dive in to the source code for KCP. Despite the project claiming to have good documentation, I disagree. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do a great job explaining itself.
The following is a breakdown of the logic of each function.
 https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp/blob/master/README.en.md  ikcp.c The main source file.
ikcp_encode8u &amp;hellip; ikcp_encode32u, ikcp_decode8u [private] A bunch of functions for byte-swapping. the encode functions write to the pointer, while the decode functions read from it, writing to the input argument.</description>

      <description>Polling methods on Unix. In generall, all methods provide a way to monitor file descriptors. So in network programming, you&amp;rsquo;d either make a list of socket FD&amp;rsquo;s, or use a single one if entirely transmitting over UDP.
Select The original.
/* According to POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008 */ #include &amp;lt;sys/select.h&amp;gt; /* According to earlier standards */ #include &amp;lt;sys/time.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;	int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout); void FD_CLR(int fd, fd_set *set); int FD_ISSET(int fd, fd_set *set); void FD_SET(int fd, fd_set *set); void FD_ZERO(fd_set *set); In general, Select is the most widely supported (even on Windows), but most limited.</description>

      <description>Generally speaking I followed this guide:
https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-gitea-on-ubuntu-18-04
My earlier attempt at installing Gitea didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work right, but this went off without a hitch.
Notable changes:
 I installed Gitea on an LXD container (so this works totally-fine) I installed the latest stable version of MariaDB (https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/) I installed the latest version of Gitea, which at the time of this writing is 1.8.0. I would recommend checking the releases here: https://dl.</description>

      <title>Notes: Migrating SVN repos to GIT</title>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/blog/2019-04-23-notes-migrating-svn-repos-to-git/</guid>
      <description>Generally I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to add. Be sure you install the GIT-SVN package first.
sudo apt install git-svn I followed this guide up to step 3:
https://gist.github.com/epicserve/1219858/9f30d5ffca7d6b6e4130c4b9b300b8167c868a5f
As well as this one: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git
I ran in to issues initially because the SVN repository I was trying to port over DIDN&amp;rsquo;T follow the norm: it had no trunk, tags, or branches folders.
The solution was pretty straight forward once I realized this is why it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working.</description>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/blog/2018-12-01-notes-easy-openvpn/</guid>
      <description>The recommended way of running OpenVPN is incredibly verbose. See here:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-18-04
That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, with a lot of places to make mistakes. That said, this is still the correct way to run OpenVPN.
An easier way is to do it via the easy-openvpn snap.
1. Setting up Easy OpenVPN Installing easy-openvpn is &amp;hellip; well, easy. The thing to understand though is Installing openvpn is only half the battle.</description>

      <description>Here we go again!
Linux like OpenGL is old, and though finding information how to use it isn&amp;rsquo;t hard, finding the right information can be. Things have changed and evolved over time, and a &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo; from years ago might not be best anymore (i.e. every article that still uses apt-get).
Sooo, like every other time I do one of these note-posts, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make sure I&amp;rsquo;m doing each step the most current/ideal/recommended way.</description>

      <title>Notes: Systemd and systemctl</title>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/blog/2018-09-26-notes-systemd-and-systemctl/</guid>
      <description>For clarity: there&amp;rsquo;s lots of references online that say use &amp;ldquo;upstart&amp;rdquo; to manage auto-starting applications. Don&amp;rsquo;t! Upstart was obsoleted, and as of Ubuntu 14.10 it&amp;rsquo;s no longer available.
The ideal way to start applications is with Systemd.
Status To check the status of services, do the following:
systemctl status This will give you a tree of all the started services.
If you see that your state is degraded, this means a service failed to start.</description>

      <title>Notes: Quick look at pkg-config</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/blog/2018-09-17-notes-quick-look-at-pkg-config/</link>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/blog/2018-09-17-notes-quick-look-at-pkg-config/</guid>
      <description>Pkg-Config is a popular tool used with autoconf to figure out what libraries are available for a target, as well as how to include/link against them. pkg-config reads the .pc files found in the lib/pkgconfig/ folder. .pc files look something like this:
prefix=/usr/local exec_prefix=${prefix} includedir=${prefix}/include libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib Name: foo Description: The foo library Version: 1.0.0 Cflags: -I${includedir}/foo Libs: -L${libdir} -lfoo A standard wrapper recommended here: https://autotools.io/pkgconfig/cross-compiling.html
#!/bin/sh  SYSROOT=/build/root export PKG_CONFIG_DIR= export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=${SYSROOT}/usr/lib/pkgconfig:${SYSROOT}/usr/share/pkgconfig export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=${SYSROOT} exec pkg-config &amp;#34;$@&amp;#34; Notably PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR needed to be set before it actually worked for me (otherwise it kept finding the stuff in my linux install).</description>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/blog/2018-09-17-notes-autoconf-and-automake/</guid>
      <description>I tend to roll my own makefiles, but I work with a number of open source packages. Time to figure out how these work once and for all.
M4 Configure scripts are shell scripts written in M4, a macro dialect that can be used in pretty-much any text file. The main configure script is actually a generated file, but we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that.
As a quick primer, an M4 file is treated as a text file until certain commants are hit.</description>

      <description>Android has changed a lot (for the better). There are still elements of Java around, but we can avoid it. The biggest plus is that we can now use the Android tools in a typical GCC/Makefile (none of this proprietary NDK garbage).
Here are some things to know.
Starting August 2019, 64bit Binaries are REQUIRED This is an important detail. Many devices are still 32bit devices, so from now on you NEED to make sure your toolchain builds both 32bit and 64bit ARM binaries.</description>

Cheat Sheet: http://www.jegerlehner.ch/intel/
Effective Address [base_reg + index_reg*scale + displacement]
Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/36704482/5678759
Segment Registers The 8086 CPU has 4 segment registers (later CPUs gained 2 more). These registers are used to workaround the 64k address space limitations of the 16bit registers by letting you freely relocate your base address (i.e. zero).
 CS - Code Segment (works with the IP Instruction Pointer register) DS - Data Segment SS - Stack Segment (works with the SP Stack Pointer register) ES - Extra Segment  CS ES (with DI and DF) The ES or Extra Segment register is like the name suggests: an extra or spare segment you can use for whatever you want&amp;hellip; as long as what you want is to write/compare with memory.</description>

      <description>The MPU-401 MIDI interface set the standard for how MIDI devices communicated on the PC. The MPU-401 was an external interface box with its own CPU and memory, attached via a custom cable to an ISA card to the PC. Other interface cards were available for hooking it up to other PC&amp;rsquo;s including the Commodore 64.
The original MPU-401 supported two modes: Intelligent mode and UART mode.
The Sound Blaster 16 (and most cards since) shipped with an MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface on the game-port.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a weird one: Some notes on how to set up an environment and develop for DOS, today!
What is the platform? All Intel CPUs starting with the 8086 support something called Real Mode. If you&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled with other retro computers and game consoles, Real Mode is the mode you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. This is in contrast to Protected Mode introduced on the 80286 and improved on the 80386 that provided a larger virtualized address space.</description>

      <description>To get a .local domain on your network, you need to install avahi.
sudo apt-install avahi-daemon From herein, hostname.local will work for accessing that machine (where hostname is the value of /etc/hostname).
If you want to change the name or extension, you can edit /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf.</description>

      <description>Rather than use an out-of-date version of Scotch/Box, here are my notes on creating a custom Vagrant Box (reference).
NOTE: These are my notes for creating butterbox, the new version (not old version).
Getting Started Pick a base distro. I&amp;rsquo;m starting with Ubuntu 18.04 &amp;ldquo;daily&amp;rdquo;.
https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/bionic64
Create a folder and do the init.
# Make the working folder mkdir butterbox cd butterbox # Make a folder for web pages (when creating a scotch/box like) mkdir www # Initialize the box vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64 This creates a Vagrantfile for you.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while (at least 4 years) since I considered using Geany as my text editor.
https://github.com/geany/geany
Unfortunately for me I&amp;rsquo;m rather stuck in my ways, trusting UltraEdit to my editing needs for over 20 years. It&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;ve felt most comfortable and home. Double unfortunately, the Linux version of UltraEdit is buggy at times, and limited in what its syntax highlighting can do. Modern languages with sub-languages like JavaScript+JSX are not supported.</description>

      <description>This seems to be surprisingly difficult information to find. Be warned, this post is scatterbrained.
startx Until now, the only way I knew to start a window manager from scratch was to run startx:
# run X startx Then running the manager explicitly:
# run Gnome gnome-session # run Unity unity # run i3wm i3 which caused the session to change. Historically you would run gnome-session --replace or unity --replace to actually replace the stock X session (or any other that was running), but this seems to be a thing of the past (Unity&amp;rsquo;s mentions the --replace command is included for compatibility).</description>

      <description>This is my criticism of Budgie (from Ubuntu Budgie Remix). Out-of-the-box, there&amp;rsquo;s no WiFi status widget. There&amp;rsquo;s a Bluetooth widget, but there&amp;rsquo;s no obvious way to check WiFi. Just a popup once a connection is established.
Things a WiFi widget must do  Show disconnected (possibly in an extra negative way to catch the users attention) Show connected (this can be neutral, but you should always be aware of a connection for activity or privacy reasons) Show connecting  If an attempt to make a connection is happening, this needs to mentioned.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Ubuntu as my main OS since 13.10 (i.e. October 2013 version). I&amp;rsquo;ve used Ubuntu 17.10 for several months now (i.e. the first version that doesn&amp;rsquo;t ship with the Unity window manager), and frankly, I don&amp;rsquo;t like it.
Unity, the window manager that has shipped with Ubuntu for a very long time, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to say it&amp;rsquo;s better than 17.10&amp;rsquo;s Gnome, but IMO it&amp;rsquo;s not worse.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used other Window Managers too, from Cinamon (Gnome 2 fork), XFCE, KDE, and just today I tried Budgie (based on Gnome 3).</description>

      <title>Notes: Vulkan begins now</title>

      <description>Vulkan was released 2 years ago right around the Game Developers Conference (usually in March). Unfortunately Windows 10 with DirectX 12 did beat them to the punch by a few months, so growth hasn&amp;rsquo;t been as quick as it could have been. Vulkan will eventually become the dominant API, though it will likely be its availablity on Mobile and Consoles that ultimately pushes it there, not PC.
It&amp;rsquo;s taken a bit, but as of Ubuntu 17.</description>

      <title>Tracking Jekyll to Wordpress (Markdownify) issues</title>

      <description>Digging a little deeper, it looks like things here haven&amp;rsquo;t exactly converted over exactly as I wanted them.
Also, in the future we are going to need a means of converting WordPress posts to Ludum Dare data, and this is a good place to start. i.e. Use Markdownify.
YouTube videos are missing Interestingly, YouTube support on GitHub is handled by &amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt; tags, which are allowed.
I managed to fix this problem myself, by introducing a small hack to Markdownify.</description>

      <description>Jekyll is a tool static website generation, similar to a blog or CMS. It&amp;rsquo;s notable because it is built in to GitHub.
Setup To run a local instance, do the following setup:
# Install Ruby sudo apt install ruby gem ruby-dev # Install Jekyll sudo gem install jekyll bundler You&amp;rsquo;re also going to want to install your theme and any plugins.
sudo gem install minima sudo gem install jekyll-admin To view the website locally, run the Jekyll server:</description>

      <description>Okay! I&amp;rsquo;ve migrated my blog to Jekyll (and GitHub).
I followed this tutorial: https://girliemac.com/blog/2013/12/27/wordpress-to-jekyll/
Notably since I ran a very old WordPress blog, I had to manually copy over all the images and things NOT found in the /wp-content/ folder. This has made my tree a bit less organized (/content/, /wp-includes/) but at least it&amp;rsquo;s all there.
Repo is here: https://github.com/mikekasprzak/blog
(not that anyone other than me cares)
Other Setup issues The default layout Jekyll doesn&amp;rsquo;t show any post content, just a list of posts.</description>

      <title>Notes: Professional Audio/Broadcasting with OBS Studio</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2018/02/25/notes-professional-broadcasting-with-obs-studio/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OBS Studio 21 is awesome! Other than the obvious (open source, cross platform), I’d say it’s finally at the point where it’s ready to be taken seriously by professional broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my list, the big thing that OBS Studio 21 brought that it was missing was Audio Ducking to the Compressor. Pair that with the Noise Gate, and you configure a clean auto-mix on any platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick look at my current audio configuration that ducks the audio whenever I speak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still experimenting with it, trying to make it better, but it gets the job done. The goal of such a configuration is something that auto-balances you and the audio, so that when you have nothing to add (commentary), more of the original audio can be enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details are below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Under View-&amp;gt;Add Interface, you can enable the Web Interface for VLC. This gives you a way to remote control VLC using HTTP requests, or simply check the status of things (like the currently playing song).
By default, the web server runs here:
http://localhost:8080/
Before you can access it, you need to set a password. Follow the instructions at the URL above (i.e. Tools-&amp;gt;Preferences then All-&amp;gt;Interface-&amp;gt;Main Interface-&amp;gt;Lua then Lua HTTP-&amp;gt;Password.
With a password set, you can access it via cURL like so:</description>

      <title>Notes: DaVinci Resolve on Ubuntu</title>

      <description>DaVinci Resolve is not designed to run on Ubuntu out-of-the-box (it’s designed for Redhat/CentOS). So we need some trickery.
Download it: https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/ca/products/davinciresolve/
Install pre-requisites:
Install OpenCL:
Install DaVinci Resolve:
This is about as far as I got.
If you ever need to repeat the genuine install step, you can delete the `/opt/resolve` folder and re-run the install. Be sure to re-own the folder though.

Without the OpenCL drivers, I get the welcome first-run, but it never actually starts once configured.</description>

      <title>Notes: EdgeMax (EdgeRouter)</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2017/10/29/notes-edgemax-edgerouter/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 22:32:58 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2017/10/29/notes-edgemax-edgerouter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes on working with an Ubiquiti EdgeRouter running EdgeMax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;factory-reset&#34;&gt;Factory Reset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever need to start over, you can factory reset by holding the Reset button for about 10 seconds, until the eth4 LED starts flashing and then becomes solidly lit. After a few seconds, the LED will turn off, and the EdgeRouter will automatically reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug your computer in to PORT 1 (eth0). Connect to &lt;a href=&#34;https://192.168.1.1&#34;&gt;https://192.168.1.1&lt;/a&gt; (note &lt;strong&gt;HTTPS&lt;/strong&gt;). Accept that it lacks a certificate. Default user account is “&lt;strong&gt;ubnt&lt;/strong&gt;” with password “&lt;strong&gt;ubnt&lt;/strong&gt;” (and no quotes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, you should do an update. At the very bottom of the page, there is buttons for &lt;strong&gt;Alert&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt;. Click &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt;, and scroll further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another tab, you’re going to want to open this link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubnt.com/download/edgemax/edgerouter-x&#34;&gt;https://www.ubnt.com/download/edgemax/edgerouter-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab the latest firmware for your EdgeRouter. Then back in the web-ui, find &lt;strong&gt;Configuration Management &amp;amp; Device Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade System Image&lt;/strong&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upload System Image&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hop over to the Wizards tab, and run the &lt;strong&gt;Basic Setup&lt;/strong&gt;. This will reconfigure the EdgeRouter so PORT 1 (eth0) uses DHCP to fetch an IP and Gateway to the internet. This is useful for connecting it to your existing network, and for when you have a Cable internet provider (i.e. no authentication required. it’s all MAC/Serial Number based).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also sets up &lt;strong&gt;switch0&lt;/strong&gt;, and a variety of other settings (NAT masquerading for the WAN connection, good WAN firewall defaults, a DHCP server for a normal LAN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dashboard&#34;&gt;The Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dashboard is the main tab you use for setting up interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the wizard, we already have a virtual Switch (switch0) ready to go. If you drill down in to switch0’s settings (&lt;strong&gt;Actions&lt;/strong&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt;), you can define or change the IP address (i.e. where you see the Router on the network), or in the VLAN tab set which ports to associate with the Switch, and optionally set a fixed VLAN address for specific ports (i.e. for connecting an untagged device).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Notes: Linux Containers</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2017/10/28/notes-linux-containers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2017 14:07:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2017/10/28/notes-linux-containers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Linux Containers are “the new hotness”. If there’s a feature Ubuntu has over other distros, its containers built-in. &lt;strong&gt;LXD&lt;/strong&gt; is the modern tool used for containers. It can be installed elsewhere, but that’s not how we roll here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linuxcontainers.org/&#34;&gt;https://linuxcontainers.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LXD containers are not VM’s, but are designed to work exactly like them. The key difference is they are fully native, and they access to hardware directly (well networking aside). You can even grant access to a GPU. Containers are a very flexible tool for your everyday Linux use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 16.04 ships with LXD 2.0, but for some of the advanced features, you’re going to want the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/ubuntu/lxd-stable&#34;&gt;https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/ubuntu/lxd-stable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with containers is &lt;strong&gt;A LOT&lt;/strong&gt; like working with vagrant boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubuntu.com/containers/lxd&#34;&gt;https://www.ubuntu.com/containers/lxd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that while LXD only runs on Linux, the client (lxc) can be run on other OS’s including Windows and Mac. What this lets you do is set up remote connections to LXD containers. I’m not going to cover remotes here, but infrastructurally speaking it can be used from other platforms (even just other Linux machines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disabling-ipv6&#34;&gt;Disabling IPv6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T DO THIS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can optionally disable IPv6 support in LXD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;strong&gt;lxdbr0&lt;/strong&gt; is the ldx-br0 bridge created during setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly though, this doesn’t change much. I thought it did more, but the containers themselves are still assuming an IPv6 IPs, just you can’t see them via &lt;code&gt;lxc list&lt;/code&gt; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/3333&#34;&gt;https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/3333&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-kernels-on-lts-ubuntu&#34;&gt;Modern Kernels on LTS Ubuntu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, you are able to make your Ubuntu install subscribe to the latest changes to the Linux kernel. There are 3 channels you can subscribe to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GA-16.04 (General Availability)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HWE-16.04 (Hardware Enablement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HWE-16.04-Edge (Cutting Edge Hardware Enablement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default Ubuntu puts you on the GA track, meaning in Ubuntu 16.04’s case, you’re getting Kernel &lt;strong&gt;4.4.x&lt;/strong&gt;. Switching to HWE, you get a current Kernel. At the time of this writing, that’s &lt;strong&gt;4.10.x&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HWE channels are good up until the next major LTS release of Ubuntu. Then you effectively get put on the GA track of the now current LTS release (i.e. 18.04 starting April 2018). It is then expected you’ll upgrade to the new LTS release, where you can begin again, switching to the next HWE series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details: &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/RollingLTSEnablementStack&#34;&gt;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/RollingLTSEnablementStack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to install HWE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then reboot to apply the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not 100% sure how necessary this is, but I was under the impression that I read something that called for newer that &lt;strong&gt;4.4.x&lt;/strong&gt; kernel. Who knows. I’ll make a note here if I find it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical also offers a live Kernel patching service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubuntu.com/server/livepatch&#34;&gt;https://www.ubuntu.com/server/livepatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable because rebooting is not required, but beyond 3 machines you need to start paying for a support plan. Also (and this is key), the livepatching services is limited to &lt;strong&gt;GA&lt;/strong&gt; releases. Yes, no &lt;strong&gt;HWE&lt;/strong&gt; kernels via livepatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux-network-interfaces&#34;&gt;Linux Network Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a key file on Ubuntu. It’s not even specific to LXD, but Linux in general. To create advanced Linux Networking configurations, from bridges to VLANs, you do it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A default Ubuntu Server install will give you a relatively simple configuration. The ever important loopback interface (lo), and a list of ethernet adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WiFi and some specialty services (VMs) are handled by other applications. Interestingly, my Ubuntu Desktop machine’s interfaces file is far more bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like in Desktop Ubuntu, another service is being run to support plug-and-play networking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chaotic Git Merging Notes</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2017 20:51:43 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2017/09/26/chaotic-git-merging-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a situation where a pair of devs were working on some code, and shared that code between them. I unfortunately wasn’t around to act as an intermediary and merge in to mainline for them. This resulted in 3 separate Push Requests with a number of conflicting changes. Add to that I started merging one set of changes, making my own changes, only to later realize there was all this overlap, so I’d effectively turned this in to a 4-way merge conflict. Oops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this more manageable, I removed my conflict from the picture. To make my changes properly, I need to see the final result of the 3 Push Requests merged in to one. So I created a new Uber Push Request that combined (and fixed) the conflicts between the 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get there, I had to learn more about GIT. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Create a folder, and move the video file in to the folder.
At this point you have files. Viewing the folder should let you see the thumbnails. You can pre and post delete any files you grabbed by accident.
If the images come from an animation, you might want to delete every-other-file.
Next use ImageMagick to build the GIF.</description>

      <description>OBS Studio ships with a bunch of audio plugins (Gate, Compressor). On Windows you can use VST Plugins too.
Like most DAW’s, the VSTs used must match the Architecture (i.e. 32bit vs 64bit).
A good set of plugins for this are these VSTs from the developer of Reaper. They are available in both 32bit and 64bit.

Configuring decent Audio I’m using a 3-stage setup.
 ReaFir (FFT) ReaEQ (EQ) ReaComp (Compressor)  ReaFir can be used to capture the noise profile of the room.</description>

      <description>Just a short one. This is an excellent article on how to get OpenVPN running on Ubuntu 16, and how to utilize it on a variety of OS’s.
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-16-04
This article is simpler, conversely doesn’t explain what’s going on as well. Notably though, as it tells you how to get the VPN working on an OpenVZ VPS.

Though as of this writing I haven’t been able to get this to route traffic correctly.</description>

      <title>Notes: Extracting Trailer Videos from Steam for Tweeting</title>

      <description>The highest quality video trailer on Steam are typically found here:
Where 256677064 is the SteamID of the game.
When you right click on a trailer video in Chrome, you can select “Open Video in New Tab“.
The t= part is probably some unique ID, such as your Steam UserID.
Edit the URL accordingly, from movie480.webm to movie_max.webm. Alternatively, full-screening the video, and after waiting a moment for it to go high quality, you can right click on the video and open the High Quality video in a new tab.</description>

      <description>Configuring this properly required me to learn a few new things.
Where to store files If you have files that should belong to a single user, place them in the user’s home folder.
/home/username/
If the files are shared across multiple users, place them in a folder under the service folder.
/srv/my-project/
 This main purpose of specifying this is so that users may find the location of the data files for particular service, and so that services which require a single tree for readonly data, writable data and scripts (such as cgi scripts) can be reasonably placed.</description>

      <description>It’s 2016, and that means security… even if it’s just sandboxing.
Modern web browsers implement a protocol called CORS, i.e. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. This is a fancy protocol that gives a web browser hints that a transaction should be allowed or not. It was a few years ago that for the sake of security, browsers switched from trusting every request to trusting no request. For the sake of compatibility, some requests are still honoured (HEAD, GET, POST with specific content-types), but some of the most useful ones are not.</description>

Changing the File Manager (Nautilus to Nemo) So, I hate the default file manager in Ubuntu. Unity is fine (meh), but the file manager is dumb. Super dumb.
In this article, a dude did a comparison of file managers available for Linux.
https://artfulrobot.uk/blog/whats-best-file-manager-ubuntu-gnome-1404-trusty
Nautilus is the default, but dude liked Nemo (very much a Sea theme going on here).
His instructions for installing Nemo weren’t too useful (old), but these are totally fine.</description>

      <description>Hello! If you’re here, you probably saw me mention that I’ll be looking for work in 2017.
I haven’t had to look for a job since 1999, so I don’t have a resume/portfolio handy. If you follow my work, you’ll know that I’m very busy right now working on Ludum Dare, and I will be for the rest of the year. Formal stuff is going to have to wait until then.</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s been available as part of the Kernel since 3.2, but thanks to the older package still being in the Ubuntu repository, it causes confusion. The following is the proper way to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>TBH I don’t have this figured out yet.
In my case, the HW clock is wrong (off by 1 hour).
It should be using NTP, but NTP doesn’t seem to take effect. I’ve read a bunch of conflicting information, like using “ntpd -qg” (which can’t be run until you stop the ntp service), or that a command “hwclock –systohc” will do it. One other dude said there’s some sort of check by hwclock that wont do it unless the date is only slightly off (safety feature).</description>

      <description>Hey! It’s more notes!


Orange Pi Lite is, IMO, the only difficult Orange Pi to get working. Primarily, because it has WiFi, and no Network socket.
For an OS, use Armbian. http://armbian.com
WARNING: the device will be unlit, no LEDs, until the OS image begins to boot. It could be half a minute before you see anything.
It can sometimes take a few tries to program the SD card correctly (either that or I’m using bad SD cards).</description>

You’re going to need a USB cable, and a jumper wire/paperclip. Ground the FEL line before plugging it in to your PC. If you’re on Linux, you’ll also have to follow some funny instructions to give your account permission to access the USB port via the Chrome web browser. For me the variable that’s supposed to be your login name wasn’t working, so I just used my login name directly.</description>

Leonardo 
  All data pins can be Digital Inputs or Outputs (i.e. D0-D13, A0-A5). Thus, 20 digital I/O pins
  Caveat: D0 and D1 are shared by the UART bus used to communicate over USB. So if you want to avoid reading/writing weird values while connected to the PC, you may want to avoid these pins.
  Pins D3, D5, D6, D9-D11, D13 have PWM’s attached to one of 3 (4) timers.</description>

      <description>Just a quick set of benchmarks, seeing how fast my servers are at downloading and uploading. These aren’t the be-all/end-all of benchmarks. They’re just a rough look at what the performance of a machine is.
The following test is used.
Linode, New Jersey: $10 VPS server, 1 core, 2 GB RAM I’m pretty happy with these results. This machine has the fastest SSD I’ve tested, and provide a good benchmark for expected performance.</description>

&lt;li&gt;SPF Records (DNS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DKIM Records (DNS + SMTP)&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>These notes are based on this.
Install GIT and BC.
Get the latest version of LetsEncrypt using GIT, placing it in /opt/.
For the next step, we’re going to need access to Port 80, so temporarily shut down your webserver.
Run LetsEncrypt.
The first time this runs, it’s going to ask for an e-mail address.
If everything worked correctly, you’ll find your certificate files here:

      <description>So this will be an ongoing project.
I used to have some old PCs sitting in my closet. They take up a lot of space, and they’re heavy. So on a whim (as it always is), I decided to gut the PCs.
One of them, apparently I had already removed the power supply, so it was gone (if I remember, it was quite noisy, so no loss). The other still had its PSU, so I’ve selected it as the donor to my bench-top power supply project.</description>

      <description>So basically, this entire series of tool research posts is the result of me searching for an Oscilloscope, and then discovering my existing workflow was bad.
I’ve lost count at how many hours I’ve spent doing homework on low cost high value scopes. I’ve explored a variety of offerings from Siglent, Rigol, Owon, Uni-T, Hantek, and others, trying to find the best value. I don’t have the desk space for an old analog scope (which is a way to get a good scope for under $100).</description>

      <description>Researching, I learned that China does make some good Soldering Stations, Hot Air Stations, even some good hybrids.
The problem is they assemble them wrong. VERY WRONG! DANGEROUSLY WRONG!
They don’t always do them wrong, but it’s best to assume it’s wrong.
If you’re up for a challenge, have another iron at your disposal, and are willing to do the homework, you can fix your cheap Chinese Iron. Replacement parts are extremely cheap, so even when things do break down, it wont cost you much to keep it going (or replace it outright).</description>

      <description>I dabble with micro-sized computers. Things like this.
The device above is something called the Orange Pi One, a cheap Chinese designed and manufactured board. Costs about $10 + shipping (~$4 to Canada).
Unlike the highly regarded Raspberry Pi Zero, it has a Quad Core ARMv7 CPU (vs. a single core ARMv6, slooow), a full sized HDMI, full sized USB, and an Ethernet Jack. Pretty amazing little machine for a tenner.</description>

And here’s a more technical guide to buying a good meter.
There’s a ton of great information packed in that video, but unfortunately dude is an experienced no-compromise electrical engineer, so his minimum recommendations cost around $100. And actually, his advice is correct if you have any interest in doing any real electronics work (Cars, AC devices, or really anything more than microcontrollers).</description>

      <description>Summary.
The PICkit connector is 6 pins, but the last pin is the Auxiliary pin.
This pin doesn’t seem to be used that often. The setup could be simplified by snipping the 6th pin.

http://www.bradsprojects.com/the-digirule/
After looking in to it, it seems the PICkit 2 is discontinued.

There isn’t even a download link there for the software.
I found the source code a rather backwards way. The link is here:</description>

      <description>Short set of notes.
The most reliable way I’ve found to connect to a remote device is to open a connection immediately after connecting the USB cable to the PC.
At this time, I haven’t figured out a clean way to disconnect and reconnect without physically unplugging. Closing the screen session (ESC-&amp;gt;CTRL+A-&amp;gt;SHIFT+D-&amp;gt;SHIFT+D) makes follow-up connections via the same line unreliable.

http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/11/05/how-i-ended-2014-and-plan-to-end-2015-a-non-jam/
This is a story.
Near the end of 2014, I started researching how to makes stuff for Commodore 64. This is something I’ve wanted to do for a very long time. The Commodore was the computer I grew up with as a kid, but as a kid, I only ever wrote some lousy BASIC programs on it. I never made anything that truly utilized the hardware.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a side project, I’m using cheap server from these guys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://buyvm.net/&#34;&gt;http://buyvm.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided that since it’s for development, I’d rather use Apache instead of NgineX. NgineX is much better than Apache when it comes to memory usage and performance, but Apache is a little easier to organize thanks to &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; files. And since Ludum Dare runs and will continue to run Apache for a while, I’ve decided to make my life working on both projects a little simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my reference, the following are my setup notes for the server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Git Notes on SSH Keys</title>

      <description>Dealing with SSH keys is confusing. Every machine you run should have a unique SSH key.
SSH keys typically consist of 2 files:
 id_rsa – Your Private Key. Used ONLY on your local machine. id_rsa.pub – Your Public Key. Give it to others (pub for public).  NEVER SHARE THE PRIVATE KEY!
The names themselves don’t matter, so feel free to rename them. It’s what the files contain that’s important.</description>

Merging 2 repositories in to one with full history In my case, the local repository (source) was project-a, and the public repository (destination) was project-b.
When I was finished merging, instead of git push -u I had to push it like so:

I am still going to be around. I’d still like to attend GDC in San Francisco every year. Ludum Dare is a thing I’ll continue to work on and run (and if I’m lucky, I might be able to enter again some day). I’m also going to continue doing little projects that amuse me, things like my Commodore 64 game from New Years.</description>

      <description>After some friends were ranting about Boost on twitter, I decided to do something about the single Boost dependency in my game code… but not the usual thing (rewriting it).
I’ve been using Boost’s operators.hpp for nearly a decade, because it actually makes writing operator code cleaner. Alas, my trimmed down subset of Boost was bringing nearly 60 source files with it, just for one file. That’s dumb. Thus, Boost without Bullshit was born:</description>

      <title>When and why use UTF-8 and UTF-16? Stringy thoughts.</title>

      <description>This was a bit of a shower thought, but until this I didn’t have a good reason to choose UTF-16 for anything.
UTF-8 makes a lot of sense. It has all the benefits of ASCII text formatting, and the ability to support additional characters above and beyond the ASCII 127 or 254. It’s very similar to ASCII, you just have to be careful with your null and extended codes. No arguments here.</description>

      <description>Today I made some modifications to cJSON, a JSON parsing C library. And like a good boy, I’ve made them available on GitHub.
https://github.com/povrazor/cjson-lax
The changes are against the strict JSON spec, but instead are usability improvements:
 Add C style /* Block Comments */ and C++ style // Line Comments. Added support for Tail Commas on the LAST LINES of Arrays and Objects  The benefits of comments in JSON should be obvious, but Tail Commas are quite the nicety.</description>

      <description>Hello 2015. The laptop I’ve been using the past few years actually fell apart, so I bought a new one. I started using Linux (Ubuntu) almost exactly 1 year ago, and as much as I like it, it’s not always the most logical and obvious OS to use, so I take notes. Here are notes.
The machine is a Lenovo X230 Tablet. It’s actually an older laptop, a 2013 model, but to put things mildly 2014 was NOT a good year for Lenovo Thinkpads.</description>

In any situation where your user interface presents a popup dialog, that process of presenting the dialog should be a function call. Here is pseudocode:
The general idea here is that there should be 2 ways to use the function: 1.</description>

      <description>Just a short one.
Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4548702/whats-the-equivalent-of-cpp-dd-for-clang
Gives you list of all symbols defined by compilers. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, that you have to feed it something (anything blank) to get this output though. /dev/null, or pipe in a blank echo (echo &amp;quot;&amp;rdquo; | gcc -dM -E -), etc.
Works with NaCl (pnacl-clang), Emscripten (emcc), and pretty much every GCC toolchain known to man.</description>

      <description>Some notes on getting NaCl working. Of course, things didn’t work out-of-the box.
Install nacl_sdk Grab and follow the instructions here:
https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/download
i.e. download and do the following:
Install 32bit Headers ‘cmon, everybody runs 64bit Linux these days (in my case Ubuntu 14.04 64bit). You need the 32bit libraries for anything to build though.
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23661718/native-client-tutorial-cant-find-libstdc
Follow Tutorial ‘make serve’ will now work.
https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/devguide/tutorial/tutorial-part1
Test2 probably wont run though. I haven’t checked, but I think it may not be a pnacl file (pnacl is necessary to run in a stock Chrome).</description>

      <description>So I was having troubles opening a VPN connection from Ubuntu 14.04. I could VPN just fine on my iPad and Android devices, but I was having no luck on Ubuntu. Looking at my /var/log/syslog, and after much Googling, it seems my problem was ‘secrets’/keyring related.
Setting up a PPTP VPN connection is easy.

What I was lacking was one very specific checkbox with many implications, none of which were spelled out.</description>

So that’s what I’ve done. I’ve split in two and sent my other half down south… okay no. I recently set up an inexpensive unmanaged BuyVM VPS server (256 MB RAM, Dual Core) in Las Vegas running a trimmed down version of Ubuntu 14.</description>

      <description>More wacky hardware, I picked up a Samsung Chromebook for cheap.

I’ve specifically been waiting for a deal on the Samsung Chromebook, as it’s quite unique: It has a Samsung Exynos SOC, which contains ARM CPU and GPU (MALI-T604). Next to NVidia’s efforts, these are some of the most powerful ARM CPUs out there. The GPU is a tiny bit dated though (same one as the original Google Nexus 10), but does support OpenGL ES 3.</description>

      <description>I’m a long time Paint Shop Pro user. I’ve used it since Paint Shop Pro 3, but I stopped upgrading after Paint Shop Pro 10. Corel acquired it between versions 9 and 10, and after 10 it was never the same. Paint Shop Pro used to be an exciting image editor that uniquely combined Raster and Vector image editor together. The killer feature would have been support for importing and exporting vector artwork as vector files (you could import vector as raster, but not vector), but alas, after the Corel acquisition, vector got ignored (Can’t compete with Corel Draw after all, that piece of sh**).</description>

      <description>Linux notes again!!?!
Yes, as it turns out I decided to replace my dead workstation PC (with beefy specs like Water Cooled Quad Core CPU, NVidia GPUs, RAID Array, etc) with a teeny tiny PC slightly larger than a stack of coasters: A Brix BXi3.

I tried using an older NVidia ION powered Nettop, but that machine really didn’t work well with Ubuntu 14.04 (The Window Manager at least). I’m told other WMs are fine, but I’d rather install a Server disto on a lacking machine like that.</description>

      <description>PerfHud ES is the best OpenGL ES debugger I’ve used, but it can be a bit tricky to set up. And now that I’m on Linux, even more so.
NVidia’s Page – Troubleshooting Notes on Forum #1
The latest PerfHud ES is now part of the Tegra Android Development Pack (2.2 as of this writing). An older version is available standalone (2.1), but the latest is now part of the pack.</description>

/2013/12/29/linux-setup-notes/
Well that post is extremely long now, and I accidentally had to reinstall it (video driver fight), so it’s time for a fresh post!
I had some complaints about Ubuntu 13.10, so I decided to go ahead and install the Alpha version of Ubuntu 14.4 (2 months before release).</description>

      <description>GCC and compatible (Clang) compilers implement a feature known as typeof (or __typeof__).
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Typeof.html
This is a pre C++11 feature, omitted from the standard, and is unavailable Visual C++.
For the most part it does what you’d expect. Given a variable, it returns the type. This lets you create another instance of a type without having to use its full name. This is helpful if you happen to be using templates.</description>

      <title>4K, HDMI, and Deep Color</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2014/01/10/4k-hdmi-and-deep-color/</link>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2014/01/10/4k-hdmi-and-deep-color/</guid>
      <description>As of this writing (January 2014), there are 2 HDMI specifications that support 4K Video (3840×2160 16:9). HDMI 1.4 and HDMI 2.0. As far as I know, there are currently no HDMI 2.0 capable TVs available in the market (though many were announced at CES this week).
A detail that tends to be neglected in all this 4K buzz is the Chroma Subsampling. If you’ve ever compared an HDMI signal against something else (DVI, VGA), and the quality looked worse, one of the reasons is because of Chroma Subsampling (for the other reason, see xvYCC at the bottom of this post).</description>

      <description>I can use the following to list all attached USB devices.
The output will be something like the following.
Take note of Device 009, i.e. “Microsoft Corp.”. Thats an Xbox One controller plugged in to a USB port.
(Also FYI, the device known as “Logic3” is a RockCandy brand Xbox 360 controller)
I can retrieve some data about the controller as follows:
Bus 001, Device 009.
It is not controller data though.</description>

      <description>Time to start the year right. After much folley and a good chunk of contract work last year, I started working on a new project. Some of the early-most efforts can be seen in the Quack tech demo video. No gameplay to see there, but you can see one of my prouder achievements in action: Live Coding/Live Content. Change a source file or an asset, and it updates in game immediately.</description>

      <description>Well, more things I’m expecting to work but don’t.
 Can’t Full-Screen a Flash Video, and multitask (the video de-full-screens upon click) With multiple monitors, full-screening flash gets confused (doesn’t fill full screen) Clicking an App Icon on Ubuntu doesn’t minimize (by design, but it’s stupid) In some parts of Ubuntu, the Backspace key acts like a back key. In other places, it does not. CTRL+Insert, SHIFT+Delete, SHIFT+Insert are not Copy, Cut, Pastes.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So whoa, I decided to do something outlandish: I switched my primary laptop to Ubuntu Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some setup notes (mainly for my own reference). My Laptop is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X220&#34;&gt;Lenovo X220&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I was able to get Ubuntu to boot correctly, I had to change my BIOS from “both Legacy and UEFI” mode to just “UEFI Mode”. To bring up the BIOS menu you press the blue ThinkVantage button. This setting can be found on the startup (?) page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-remapping&#34;&gt;Key Remapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lenovo X220 has Web Forward/Back keys beside the arrow keys. I prefer that they act like alternative PageUp and PageDown keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;strong&gt;/usr/share/X11/symbols/inet&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. sudo gedit /usr/share/X11/symbols/inet)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a key named &lt;strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Change “XF86Back” to “&lt;strong&gt;Prior&lt;/strong&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a key named &lt;strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Change “XF86Forward” to “&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browse to &lt;strong&gt;/var/lib/xkb/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delete *&lt;strong&gt;.xkm&lt;/strong&gt; in the /var/lib/xkb folder. You &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to do this to force a keyboard code refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logout, then Login to refresh. (Or reboot)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mesa 10.0 was released in December 2013 (now Mesa 10.1), which introduces OpenGL 3.3 support. Ubuntu 13.10 came out back in October (i.e. 2013-10), so it lacks this update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?50038-Updated-and-Optimized-Ubuntu-Free-Graphics-Drivers&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The current MESA drivers (10.0.2) only support OpenGL 3.0 on the Intel HD 3000 (where as Windows supports OpenGL 3.1, plus many 3.2 and 3.3 extensions). Newer Intel GPUs (the HD 4000 and the HD 2500) should support up to OpenGL 3.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The Intel HD 3000 does not support OpenCL. Newer Intel GPUs do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially while playing video drivers, if you screw something up, you can &lt;strong&gt;hold SHIFT&lt;/strong&gt; during boot to bring up the GRUB menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow instructions. Fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attach a DVD drive, and insert a Windows 7 CD (NOT a restore CD). Create a VM. Adjust settings accordingly (half your RAM, equal number of CPU cores, ~60 GB of space).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support Intel GPU drivers, open up the “???.vmx” file (where ??? is your VM name). Add the following line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; VMWare Player 6.0.1 only supports OpenGL 2.1 on Windows 7 (i.e. on par with OpenGL ES 2.0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disable-touchpad&#34;&gt;Disable Touchpad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a Lenovo laptop for a reason: It has a nub-mouse (joystick). I prefer this to touchpads. However, by default both input methods attempt to work at the same time. This can cause weird glitches, like random copy/pasting or focus loss. An easy fix is to just outright disable the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place files in &lt;strong&gt;~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/&lt;/strong&gt; that you want to make available from the right click menu. If a shell script, be sure to set it Executable (chmod +x). Also feel free to ignore adding a “.sh” file extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful Script: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/10/enable-open-as-administrator-ubuntu-13-10-nautilus/&#34;&gt;Run as Root&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-player&#34;&gt;Music Player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;Audacious&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Track can be found under the Speaker Icon in the Panel (I wish there was a track/name up there). A preinstalled plugin AOSD can be enabled for a “Current Track” popup, whenever the song changes. There’s another plugin which enables media keys (FN+Arrows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;image-editing&#34;&gt;Image Editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;GIMP&lt;/strong&gt;. For reals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run it. Go to the &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; menu and click &lt;strong&gt;Single-Window Mode&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, it’s 100x more tollerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNG files are exported, not saved (unlike Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calculator&#34;&gt;Calculator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;SpeedCrunch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gdebugger&#34;&gt;gDEBugger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t actually work, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gremedy.com/downloadLinux.php&#34;&gt;Download it&lt;/a&gt;. Unzip it to /opt/gDEBugger/ (or some other nice folder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a symlink so gDEBugger can find the 64bit GL libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;strong&gt;/opt/gDEBugger/gDEBugger&lt;/strong&gt; to start it. NOTE: gDEBugger-bin wont run directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More OpenGL &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Debugging_Tools&#34;&gt;debug tools are here&lt;/a&gt; (glslDevil?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;codexl-openglopencl-debugger&#34;&gt;CodeXL (OpenGL/OpenCL Debugger)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems easy to install, but &lt;strong&gt;REQUIRES&lt;/strong&gt; an OpenCL capable GPU. Sorry Intel HD 3000. 🙁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apitrace-opengl-command-logger-and-post-run-trace-tools&#34;&gt;APITrace (OpenGL command logger and post-run trace tools)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this is the only Linux GPU debugger worth a damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-android-sdk&#34;&gt;Install Android SDK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy. First install Java and Ant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the “&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html&#34;&gt;SDK Tools Only&lt;/a&gt;” bundle. Unzip it somewhere (i.e. &lt;strong&gt;/opt/android-sdk/&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the SDK Manager&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html#Downloads&#34;&gt;NDK Package&lt;/a&gt;. Put it somewhere similar as the sdk (i.e. &lt;strong&gt;/opt/android-ndk/&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set path and variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-nvidia-perfhud-es&#34;&gt;Install NVidia PerfHud ES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMO this is the best OpenGL debugger available (it shows geometry!), but it only supports NVidia Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.nvidia.com/tegra-resources&#34;&gt;Tegra Android Development Pack&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an executable that downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deselect everything but PerfHud ES. Install it somewhere common (i.e. &lt;strong&gt;/opt/NVPACK/&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-the-pod-blender-exporter&#34;&gt;Setting up the POD Blender Exporter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/insider/sdkdownloads/&#34;&gt;PowerVR SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browse to &lt;strong&gt;/opt/Imagination/PowerVR/GraphicsSDK/PVRGeoPOD/Plugins/Blender/Linux_x86_64&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy &lt;strong&gt;PVRGeoPODScript.py&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;libPVRGeoPod.so&lt;/strong&gt; to your &lt;strong&gt;/opt/blender/2.69/scripts/addons&lt;/strong&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy &lt;strong&gt;libQtCore.so.4&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;libQtGui.so.4&lt;/strong&gt; to your &lt;strong&gt;/opt/blender&lt;/strong&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start Blender. Go to &lt;strong&gt;File-&amp;gt;User Preferences-&amp;gt;Addons&lt;/strong&gt;. Search for “pod”, and click the checkbox beside &lt;strong&gt;Import-Export: PVRGeoPod&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done. Exporter can now be found under &lt;strong&gt;File-&amp;gt;Export-&amp;gt;PVRGeoPod&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-spine&#34;&gt;Setting up Spine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spine just works, so long as you have Java installed (see Android).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download it, move it to /opt/, paste in your reg code, and go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lower-compiz-cpu-usage&#34;&gt;Lower Compiz CPU usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiz has “Sync to VBlank” enabled by default. Causes a wasted 10% extra CPU usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Compiz Config Settings. Click on OpenGL (not the checkbox, the name). Unselect Sync to VBlank. Reboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fix-audio-playback-in-audacity&#34;&gt;Fix Audio Playback in Audacity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Solved. Ignore everything below. To get audio playback working correctly in Audacity (and not silly weird glitch fast), simply select the “&lt;strong&gt;Samson GoMic: USB Audio (hw:1,0)&lt;/strong&gt;” for output, instead of one of the many defaults. Fixed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: This is incorrect. A good try though. Problem is the Samson Go Mic that I’m using as an audio interface. Audacity works fine with the internal sound card (which has a horrible mic). Oddly though, recording via the Samson appears to work though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up “&lt;strong&gt;/etc/pulse/default.pa&lt;/strong&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assumed this was the problem with my PS4 controller not working wirelessly (disconnecting right away). This is not the case though. Default detection via Bluetooth works fine under Linux. Now I’m just hoping the problem is that the battery is low (have it plugged in charging).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dangers-of-the-oibaf-drivers&#34;&gt;The Dangers of the OIBAF drivers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/graphics-drivers&#34;&gt;OIBAF MESA drivers&lt;/a&gt; are great. Bleeding edge Linux graphics drivers, with the very latest supported OpenGL features (GL 3.0 on my Intel HD 3000 GPU). We’re in a transition period though. Mesa just reached a very important milestone, several months after Ubuntu 13.10’s release: OpenGL 3.x support (i.e. Mesa 10.x). The upcoming Ubuntu 14.4 will ship with these new Mesa drivers, but gosh darnit, I’m doing serious GL shader development, and I need them now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first installed them, everything was great. According to &lt;strong&gt;/var/log/apt/history.log&lt;/strong&gt;, my version of OIBAF was from January 10th, 2014. A few days ago I upgraded to the very latest, and that broke both &lt;strong&gt;Chrome&lt;/strong&gt; and more importantly &lt;strong&gt;VMware&lt;/strong&gt;. My game stuff unusually is working fine with the new drivers, but the current drivers from today are busted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I need to do: Uninstall OIBAF, then reinstall an older version of OIBAF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uninstalling-a-ppa-oibaf&#34;&gt;Uninstalling a PPA (OIBAF)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First install PPA Purge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then use it to purge the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’d recommend a reboot, but Logging out and in *may* work (I can’t remember).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;checking-installed-mesagl-version&#34;&gt;Checking Installed Mesa/GL version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 13.10 ships with Mesa 9.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-oibaf&#34;&gt;Installing OIBAF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is easy. I’d suggest checking your Mesa version first (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the 2nd line is just &lt;strong&gt;upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;, not &lt;strong&gt;dist-upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;. Both functions do the same thing, but if I understand correctly, &lt;strong&gt;upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; doesn’t uninstall obsolete packages, while &lt;strong&gt;dist-upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; does. So &lt;strong&gt;dist-upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; is the smart one. This means that downgrading to Mesa 9.2 (as I had to do) required a full re-download of Mesa 9.2, as it was already removed from my machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta get away from this awful version of Nautilus. Ugh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Uninstalling OIBAF before doing a release upgrade is recommended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-apt-cache&#34;&gt;The Apt Cache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/var/cache/apt/archives/&lt;/strong&gt; contains cached copies of packages you’ve downloaded. I lucked out, finding my January 10th version of the OIBAF drivers here, so there may still be some hope to downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tecmint.com/useful-basic-commands-of-apt-get-and-apt-cache-for-package-management/&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To list all installed packages, do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extremely long list that omits version numbers. If you know roughly what the package you want is named, you can include the first part of the name like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, this is really only useful if you know what a package is named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To search the package database for something, use search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also includes descriptions of packages, which can be extremely helpful for discovering exactly what package you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get information about a package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way, with a slightly different output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List just the install options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, whodathunk. “Madison” ‘eh?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A video demonstration of the tech behind my upcoming game code named #MRK. A look more at the fancy Live Coding features built in to the engine. Everything works so well, it can be used for very rapid iterative development. The program never stops, all asset and code files are automatically reloaded, and if used correctly game state will stay the same across reloads.
I’m hoping to do more videos as I introduce more general features, as well as when I have things to show in #MRK.</description>

      <description>According to the documentation, SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION was primarily used to tell SDL which method to use to construct the Window on desktop Open. OpenGL 3.x introduces a new way of context creation, so this would have been used to suggest which way to create (old way or new way). Of course, Mobile needed a way to handle ES 1.1 vs ES 2.0 (and sort-of ES 3.0 too, but so far the ES 3.</description>

      <description>By correct, I mean the way that will work across multiple devices, and give you OpenGL (ES) shaders.
If you don’t need shaders (i.e. OpenGL 1.x, OpenGL ES 1.1), a lone SDL_Init will suffice (default behavior).
If you are using SDL_GL_LoadLibrary, you *MUST* put the calls in the following order.
I had to do it this way (between these 2 calls), otherwise Android devices with PowerVR GPUs would not work (Nexus S, Intel powered devices, Kindle Fire?</description>

      <description>Here are some notes on getting the GPU/OpenGL ES debuggers working with devices.
NVidia’s Tegra tool seems the best (even has integrated mesh viewer). Qualcomm’s Adreno tool is also quite good. ARM’s MALI tool is difficult to set up (rooting), but covers the essentials. Intel’s GPA tool is a complete suite, but is only a system usage profiler for Android. Imagination’s PowerVR tools appear good, though I haven’t tested them yet (one tool requires rooting).</description>

      <description>Been thinking a bunch about the vector math classes mentioned in the previous post (vec2, vec3, etc). I was ready to try proposing “something” to let you add .anything to a class to access members hidden in (say) userdata. As it turns out, that already works.
The _get and _set metamethods talk about indexes in the documentation, so I mistakenly assumed they were for creating array-like syntax (maybe they are too), but in actuality they do exactly what I want: let you handle .</description>

      <description>Squirrel features both Delegates and Classes for creating types and providing default values and actions. They are mutually exclusive, meaning you either use a class or a delegate (attached to a table/array).
The following is a collection of notes on Classes.
Sample Class The class below features a constructor, metamethods (like operator overloading), and a few additional functions.

      <description>Phew! Okay, my little science experiment from today (i.e. why I needed a makefile): SquirrelyJS.

SquirrelyJS is a Squirrel Programming Language compiler and VM running in the browser. So it’s a bunch of JavaScript code, a bunch of C/C++ code compiled using Emscripten, all wired up to a shittyweb page.
It’s barebones at the moment. You can edit/change/replace the code in the left side, and hit the Compile buttons to recompile it.</description>

      <title>Barebones Useful Generic Makefile</title>

      <description>This seems to happen a lot for me. I’m testing/playing around with some code thing, and I set up some cheeseball compiling in a shell script. Then I get to a point and it’s just not enough, the compiling is taking too long, or so one. My major projects often have a nice makefile setup going, but my experiments, not so much. That’s because writing a makefile, despite being the same thing again and again for me, is tricky to get right.</description>

      <description>So I’ve done a few scatterbrained posts lately that talk about things. Most of them had rather open ended conclusions, that were followed by wildly out-of-left field follow up posts. Here’s me making sense of that.
Evaluating Middlewares: Unity does good 3D, bad at JS Unity’s “JavaScript” isn’t JavaScript, it’s better named UnityScript. UnityScript is kinda terrible, essentially being just a different syntaxed less featured C#. But var is allowed, so uhhh… *shrug*.</description>

      <description>So last year, Derek and I created a little game called Nook. Nook was an interesting game that was half JavaScript and half C++, running in the browser (as 100% JavaScript). Things were still new with Emscripten. At the time it had only recently reached the point where it could work with standard C++ libraries without issue. Performance claims were about 6x slower than native. Everything worked out great, so I did little writeup on it:</description>

      <title>Evaluating JavaScript to Native-App Packagers</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2013/05/07/evaluating-javascript-to-native-app-packagers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 23:31:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2013/05/07/evaluating-javascript-to-native-app-packagers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;EDIT: For reference I’m leaving this post as-is (except for the new ending), but it seems AppJS is a lot more painful to use after all. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I need to write a tool with a UI. I want it to be portable, just in case. And because JavaScript is “fine”, I’m investigating what packaging options there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not doing a very scientific test. All I’m doing is throwing TOOM, an adventure game Derek Laufman and I made for Ludum Dare 26 at it. If it works, I’m happy. If it fails, I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOOM uses SoundJS and PreloadJS. PreloadJS wont work if the browser is reading from the local file system (i.e. file:///blah.html). So developing TOOM, I’ve had to use a tiny webserver running locally (currently &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/&#34;&gt;Mongoose&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=&#34;http://sourceforge.net/projects/miniweb/&#34;&gt;MiniWeb&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chrome-packaged-apps&#34;&gt;Chrome Packaged Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html&#34;&gt;http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the name, despite the wording, this doesn’t create standalone apps. It creates content for distribution by Google’s Chrome App Store only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also not officially live yet. You can make apps, test them, but can’t Publish. Beh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;node-webkit&#34;&gt;Node-Webkit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit&#34;&gt;https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good simple solution, based on NodeJS and Chromium, regularly updated (Intel Sponsored), but fails the TOOM test. It starts loading, but dies at an unusual place (complaining about one of my source files missing… which is definitely there if it can start loading at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adds about &lt;strong&gt;54 MB&lt;/strong&gt; to the total size (~23 MB zipped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;appjs&#34;&gt;AppJS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://appjs.org/&#34;&gt;http://appjs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fantastic solution, also based on NodeJS and Chromium, and so far the only thing to pass the TOOM test (no audio and slower, so clearly using an older version of Chromium). The very very saddening part however is that there’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/appjs-dev/IWRN8FaAheU&#34;&gt;only 1 guy on the project&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s too busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also adds about &lt;strong&gt;54 MB&lt;/strong&gt; to the total size (~22 MB zipped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-2012&#34;&gt;Visual Studio 2012&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng#downloads&#34;&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng#downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untested, but this option is Windows only, and there may be other caveats. Any code written for DiskIO and file manipulation will only work on Windows. No WebGL support. That said, the JS code may compile down to CLI bytecodes (dot net), so performance might be better. Also how an app is structured may not mirror how a web project is created (index.html and all files). Untested though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adobe-air&#34;&gt;Adobe Air&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html&#34;&gt;http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Created my &lt;a href=&#34;http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118666ade46-7ff1.html&#34;&gt;descriptor file&lt;/a&gt;, modified it to use the HTML file, then ran it with adl (adl D:\Toom\application.xml). After fixing the one bug it reported, it just sits there… waiting. Running I assume, but there’s no action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Instructions for running and packaging I found inside “AIR SDK Readme.txt” in AirSDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tidesdk&#34;&gt;TideSDK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tidesdk.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.tidesdk.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as Appcelerator Titanium for Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, another one that passes the TOOM test. TideSDK is based on Webkit, but a seemingly an older version of webkit. CSS Fonts did not work, the framerate was even slower than AppJS, and no audio. Still, it was interesting. Downside is they seem to be short on funds too; Their blog reminds me of PBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-choices-no-good-ones&#34;&gt;More choices, no good ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11015811/html5-desktop-wrapper-framework&#34;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11015811/html5-desktop-wrapper-framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no safe/good/active choice, but AppJS impressed me the most. As far as portability goes, I think what I want to be using is something that combines Chrome and NodeJS, but not Webkit. Plus it gives me a reason to learn NodeJS too. My Browser performance and debugging experience is just so much better with Chrome, even though I don’t use it as a primary browser (I use Firefox instead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrettably AppJS right now today is a bit of a gamble, since it’s just one dude behind it, and he’s made it clear he doesn’t have the time. But it does exactly what I want, so *shrug*. There’s talk of a Kickstarter, and I hope this sees the light of day. Totally a worthwhile project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-twist&#34;&gt;PLOT TWIST!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a good one though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I hadn’t really realized before was how AppJS is actually working. From what I can tell, it’s actually running a small web server, i.e. the NodeJS part. Your main JS script file is standalone and disconnected from what runs in the browser context… YET, you control maximizing/minimizing windows, the contents of menus, task bar appearance from the NodeJS side. Your app is standalaone, caged inside the browser context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there may be a way to pass data between the NodeJS side and Chromium side, similar to making web requests in general. It’s not documented though, so *sigh* not sure where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node-Webkit might actually be more of what I want, since it’s about introducing the Node features in to Webkit. That said, it failed the TOOM test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well, enough of this for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>So I’m typically a native C/C++ programmer, and I seem to surprise people when I say I like JavaScript yet dislike C# and Java. What I like about JavaScript is that it does things C and C++ don’t, as opposed to C# and Java that take C++ and as a base and enforce new constraints to “simplify” code. Both C# and Java do improve on C++, but I find the new strictness they impose to be a detriment or intermediary fix.</description>

      <description>The following is some rambling. I have a point I’m trying to make, but I’m certain I don’t make it. My fingers kept moving, and this is what resulted. You can kinda get an idea what sort of madness is bouncing around in the ‘ol noodle right now though. Good luck.
 *Big Sigh*
I’m typically a “from scratch”, “native code is best”, “c++ FTW” type of developer. The thing is, developers with my skillset and experience really are at a big disadvantage in today’s game market.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I began a process of rebranding my company. Shortly after leaving my AAA job in 2005, I created this logo.

Thing is, that’s not even one of the better logos I used, it’s just the most business’y one.
More here.
As you can see, I used to be really in to playing with typography. Sykhronics is a name I’ve been using for the past 15 years. In the early days, it was my portfolio website.</description>

      <description>This is a modification for the social deception game The Werewolves of Millers Hollow (also sometimes known as Werewolf, Mafia, and Witch Hunt).
Pick an unused card from the deck. I like the Witch (the orange card). Herein, this card is now known as the Predator (or Chupacabra, because it’s funnier). The Predator is an additional “non human”, and its goal is to hunt and kill off the Werewolves. The humans are indifferent and want to kill anything that isn’t a human (after all, it has no qualms about killing humans to find wolves).</description>

      <title>MinGW Library Building Notes (POCO)</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/12/05/mingw-library-building-notes-poco/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 06:09:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/12/05/mingw-library-building-notes-poco/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been evaluating some new libraries lately and as usual, I decided to take some notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;poco&#34;&gt;POCO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pocoproject.org/&#34;&gt;POCO&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a nice complete C++ library filled with things that other languages like Python and Java have. It’s very feature filled, but it’s unfortunately obvious that the development team doesn’t spend much time working or testing on Windows (and when they do, it’s with MSVC). There is a MinGW build, but as of &lt;strong&gt;POCO 1.4.5&lt;/strong&gt; it’s designed for Cygwin MinGW, which is a variation of MinGW that you invoke with “&lt;strong&gt;-mno-cygwin&lt;/strong&gt;” to remove dependence on the Cygwin libraries. No good for a pure &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mingw.org&#34;&gt;MinGW+MSys&lt;/a&gt; user like myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I had to make the following changes to &lt;strong&gt;build/config/MinGW&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to actually compile and use exchndl.dll (DrMinGW)</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/12/02/how-to-actually-compile-and-use-exchndl-dll-drmingw/</link>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/12/02/how-to-actually-compile-and-use-exchndl-dll-drmingw/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DrMinGW is a fancy crash detection program for MinGW programs. Details can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/DrMingw&#34;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/DrMingw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the really cool features of DrMinGW is you can alternatively invoke a DLL from your program to catch your crashes, instead of requiring you or your testers to install DrMinGW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is the library and DLL aren’t available for download, and building it from sources requires SCONS, which I can’t seem to get to work with it. So, my solution is to build it manually. Unfortunately, building it requires knowledge of some of the secret defines set by SCONS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a strange developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preferred development environment is &lt;a href=&#34;http://gcc.gnu.org&#34;&gt;GCC&lt;/a&gt; running in a simulated BASH shell on Windows. This madness all started well over a decade ago when I first discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/&#34;&gt;DJGPP&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://gcc.gnu.org&#34;&gt;GCC&lt;/a&gt; for DOS. This means GCC was my first C and C++ compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now sure, like most kids (?!) I used Visual C++ in College. That was mainly for my school projects though. Whenever it was me time, I was rocking the DJGPP. To be honest, I can’t really remember when I switched away from DJGPP, but I’m fairly certain I was still using it in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;End of 1999 I was hired by long forgotten game developer Sandbox Studios as a GameBoy programmer. I had been dabbling with the GameBoy homebrew during the summer of 1999, made some little games, and won some stuff in a contest (Flashcarts). This lead to me using a GameBoy assembler called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.otakunozoku.com/rednex-gameboy-development-system/&#34;&gt;RGBDS&lt;/a&gt; (Rednex GameBoy Development Suite), which was a great little macro assembler suite. All command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point: I’ve been comfortably working in command lines and shells for a long time. And I do it on Windows, where everybody else uses Visual Studio. I treat my Windows as a Linux box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past decade, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cygwin.com&#34;&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mingw.org&#34;&gt;MinGW/MSYS&lt;/a&gt; have been the go-to ways of working Linux’y on Windows. I used to use a lot of Cygwin, especially since all the major video game console toolchains of the time were GCC based, and Cygwin did a much better job at simulating/hosting/building a GCC cross compiler. GameBoy Advance, PlayStation, though there were some alternatives (SN, CodeWarrior), in my books GCC was the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I rarely use Cygwin, but I always keep it around. Instead I use MinGW, which is a GCC port with a mostly compatible set of Win32 libraries, and MSYS (a minimal Bash/Cygwin like environment). It’s had its rough moments over the years, but for my needs I find it to be the better of the two. Cygwin’s goals are to simulate Unix on Windows. MinGW/MSYS’s goals are to target Windows with GCC. Why half-ass it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>C&#43;&#43;11 Compiler Support Wishlist</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/11/12/c11-compiler-support-wishlist/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 11:41:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/11/12/c11-compiler-support-wishlist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months back I did this little investigation in to &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2012/08/25/practical-c11-support-for-game-developers/&#34;&gt;C++11 support across compilers&lt;/a&gt;. The goal here was to figure out what C++11 features I could safely use today. I also ended up creating a useful list of compiler versions sorted by platform. I will continue, at least for the near term, updating this list as I see changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is a follow up to that. I’m more familiar now with the actual use of many of these ‘nextgen’ features, so this post is a brief on certain features I really want to use, and why I can or can not use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Safe C&#43;&#43; Pointers to Member Functions (Functors)</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/11/11/safe-c-pointers-to-member-functions/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2012 18:35:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/11/11/safe-c-pointers-to-member-functions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did a post some time ago on a threading library called &lt;strong&gt;TinyThread++&lt;/strong&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2012/09/21/cross-platform-c-threading-today/&#34;&gt;find it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like always, the following is just a collection of notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item 1: &lt;strong&gt;TinyThread++&lt;/strong&gt; is an almost functionally equivalent alternative to C++11 threads, but instead of taking multiple arguments to the thread it takes a single void*. When C++11 support improves everywhere, that will be the time to switch. But in the meantime, a void* is a good compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item 2: Whenever I describe how and why a member function is different than a global/static function, I often say that a member function has a “secret 1st argument, the ‘this’ pointer”. Heck, if I was going to build a C++ compiler, I would implement it like this. So for the longest time I just assumed this is how others implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is true, then it should be possible to convert a member function in to a “void Func(void*)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, this behavior is forbidden by the C++ standard. That said, it works in &lt;strong&gt;GCC&lt;/strong&gt;, but fails in &lt;strong&gt;MSVC&lt;/strong&gt;. In GCC’s case, while it does work, it invokes a warning known as “pmf-conversions”. You can explicitly disable the warning with “-Wno-pmf-conversions”, but given that this just doesn’t work in Visual Studio it’s probably unwise to do in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nice solution was to add a static proxy function that takes a single “this class” pointer, and call the function as if it was a member of the class (because it is).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>So hey. I wrote and open sourced a small cross platform library for getting the IP and MAC address of the current device. You can find it here:
https://github.com/povrazor/net-adapter
So far I’ve tested it on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and Mac OSX Mountain Lion. It *should* also work on iOS, BSD and Android. If you happen to test it on one of those other platforms, I would love to know what the Sample program outputs.</description>

      <title>HTTP GET and POST&amp;#8217;s from scratch with Sockets</title>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/10/18/http-get-and-posts-from-scratch-with-sockets/</guid>
      <description>So I’ve done a bunch of networking research lately, and have actually decided I’m not going to continue writing my own HTTP GETter and POSTer. Instead, I’ll be using libcurl. That said, I am not that comfortable using 3rd party libraries and tools unless I have a solid understanding of how they work internally.
So this is a collection of notes on how to do HTTP GET and POST requests, in case I ever need to come back and do this from scratch (because I’m not going to remember all this).</description>

      <title>Cross Platform C&#43;&#43; Threading Today</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/09/21/cross-platform-c-threading-today/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2012 00:35:26 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2012/09/21/cross-platform-c-threading-today/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;C++11 finally brings threading in to the core C++ language. Unfortunately, as my &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2012/08/25/practical-c11-support-for-game-developers/&#34;&gt;little investigation found&lt;/a&gt;, we’re not quite all there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s okay though, ’cause as it turns out, most of core function of C++ threading can be emulated using standard C and C++ features. While doing something else, I stumbled upon a library &lt;strong&gt;TinyThread++&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s lightweight (2+1 source files), cross platform, and free+open source in the best ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tinythreadpp.bitsnbites.eu/&#34;&gt;http://tinythreadpp.bitsnbites.eu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TinyThread++&lt;/strong&gt; attempts to emulate the usage of standard C++11 threading, in a decent, good enough, compromise way. I like it, so instead of fooling around with pThreads and whatever classic Microsoft APIs do, I’m going to use it. And since it’s so simple (2+1 files), if I need something or need to fix something, it’s right there. Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, there is an equivalent C variant: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinycthread.bitsnbites.eu/&#34;&gt;http://tinycthread.bitsnbites.eu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>So it’s Ludum Dare 24 weekend (Aug 24th), and I’m finally catching up on some work I had to put off as I … ahem … attended to my duties. Now that the event is going strong, it’s reading time!
The main thing I need to do is some Windows 8 research. I installed the Windows 8 RTM (release) Trial on a new machine earlier this week, as well as the Visual Studio 2012 Express.</description>

      <description>So, I’ve been dabbling with something new.
One of the frustrating conclusions I came to whilst working on “Alone, The” was that content creation was way, far far, too much work. I went in to the project with some strong ideals about procedural content being lifeless and uninteresting. I still somewhat believe that, but when reality kicks in, you realize one can not make a seriously large game alone at a decent pace without being somewhat procedural.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I run an online game-jam event called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ludum Dare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and this past weekend I got together with a friend (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/laufman&#34;&gt;Derek Laufman&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.halfbot.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halfbot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and we made a game. What did we make? A platformer about size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was created over a period 72 hours. Somehow, amazing to me, we managed to pull it together despite our responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me running the event (Ludum Dare)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family gathering at my brothers I attended on the Saturday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Car appointment on Monday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derek taking care of his baby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, running Ludum Dare is only busy for me before the event, and at submission time (two of them, 3-5 hours each). During the event I’m free to sit down and do whatever I want. This weekend was the &lt;strong&gt;Diablo 3 beta test&lt;/strong&gt;, and if I was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markfassett.com&#34;&gt;lesser man&lt;/a&gt;, I’d have played that. Fortunately for me, Derek came to me a couple weeks ago and suggested we make a game together, I said yes, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s totally silly, but I’m actually proud of the fact that I managed to attend the family gathering and the car appointment. Stupid me, I could have actually cancelled/rescheduled the appointment for Tuesday or Wednesday, but I decided to go ahead with it anyway. The car appointment was my &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2010/04/08/automobiles-interviews-all-smiles/&#34;&gt;yearly service for my smartcar&lt;/a&gt;, and I ended up staying in the neighborhood of the dealership for about 5 hours of that day. Working on my Ludum Dare game on my laptop, I had WIFI at the dealership, and also McDonalds, where I parked myself for a couple hours. To be honest, this was probably the first time I seriously “Coffee Shop Developed”, and where I actually got some serious work done. It was fun, because it was out of the ordinary. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that’s enough back story. Lets get nerdy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello! This is quite possibly the last post I’ll do in 2011, so lets make with the goods!
This past week I’ve continued working on the demake of my primary project. If you checked out the Ludum Dare prototype, the core mechanics have dramatically improved since then (about 4 days ago).
I actually keep a relatively detailed development Journal while working, but a lot of stuff is either very minor, subtle, contains spoilers, or is simply just too long to post.</description>

      <description>I wont talk too much about how Ludum Dare itself went, as I’ve already done that over here.
But in addition to running the event, I participated for the first time in a long time. The theme was “Alone“, which I find funny given the title of my game. Could I not enter? 😉
About a week before Ludum Dare, I started toying with the idea of creating a demake of my game.</description>

      <description>Pekka posed a good question recently that got me thinking: The default Bash shell that comes with MinGW (MSys) kinda sucks. You can’t resize the Window, selections are this odd visible only thing, in essence: it works like an ordinary windows cmd shell.
The solution is surprisingly straight forward: Use MinTTY.
Open up a MinGW shell, and do the following:
 mingw-get install mintty
 A few moments later, you’ll have MinTTY installed.</description>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2011/11/26/blackberry-playbook-ndk-command-line-quickstart-guide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.galcon.com&#34;&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; keeps telling me I need to document what I do. After all, I’ve worked on a ridiculous number of platforms, and with many SDK’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So alright, I’m going to record and share my notes here. I’m going to assume you have your own build system figured out, and cover the highlights and key things you need to know and do to get native code up and running on the PlayBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;device-summary&#34;&gt;Device Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few highlights about the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual Core 1 GHz ARM Coretex-A9 w/ Neon, 7″ 1024×600 IPS LCD (drool), PowerVR SGX 540 GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDK Available. Work either through a custom Eclipse IDE, or entirely from the command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command line is a typical GCC cross compiler setup, with custom tools for packaging/deploying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux-like platform. EGL and GLES1/GLES2 available. OpenAL available (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codedojo.com/?p=1439&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlackBerry packages are BAR files, which are actually JAR files, which are actually ZIP files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was on sale for just $199 during the weeks surrounding “Black Friday”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1-request-signing-keys&#34;&gt;Step 1. Request Signing Keys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is step 1 because how long it takes is entirely outside your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.blackberry.com/native/signingkey&#34;&gt;http://developer.blackberry.com/native/signingkey&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys/&#34;&gt;ALT&lt;/a&gt;) and make your request. Typically within a few hours you will get a series of e-mails containing &lt;strong&gt;.csj&lt;/strong&gt; files, so if you’ve previously downloaded the SDK, you’ll be waiting a while before you can test on device. More details &lt;a href=&#34;https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/documentation/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.quickstart/topic/request_code_sign_key.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; REMEMBER YOUR PIN AND COMPANY NAME! YOU WILL NEED IT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For times like these, I like to create a text file containing the signing code, and put it alongside the signing keys. Yes, technically that partially defeats the security purpose of the keys, but keys and signing is usually such-a-pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1b-apply-for-a-blackberry-appworld-vendor-account&#34;&gt;Step 1b. Apply for a Blackberry AppWorld Vendor account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also takes a while, so do this early to get in the queue sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/&#34;&gt;https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will eventually get an email asking for a scan of government issued ID such as a drivers license, or business related documents (to prove you are real). If you have these ready, you can respond to the request quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payments are via Paypal, so you will need a valid Paypal account to be paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-2-get-the-ndk&#34;&gt;Step 2. Get the NDK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah! You can do it! Click them links and go go go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/&#34;&gt;https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the downloader tries to install some Akamai service thingy. I couldn’t get this working, but that’s okay. There’s an option to say “&lt;strong&gt;this did not work&lt;/strong&gt;” in the popup box, and after the popup closes there’s an option to download directly without Akamai. Use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The past month has been extremely good for progress. I did not meet my goal for the month, but I’d be silly to complain. Yadda yadda ya.

 That’s cool Mike, but what is it?

      <description>NAS time, again! Like before, I’m collecting my notes and thoughts all in one place.
Two months later As mentioned in my earlier posts, I’m running both SVN and AppDailySales on it (iTunes Connect Sales Stat grabber). In addition, I’ve been running an internal wiki on it. I used to host 2 different external wikis, but both have been imported and archived locally.
I chose DokuWiki for my internal wiki because it uses flat files, meaning I don’t have to run SQL (though it is just a button to enable MySQL on the Synology).</description>

      <description>Here’s some notes from my internal wiki.
How to export .bullet data from a Blender 2.5x scene (awfully close to 2.6 now ‘eh). This might be as of Blender 2.57, and should continue to work well in to 2.6x.
 Exporting Bullet Data from Blender Exporting Bullet Physics data from Blender is a pain in the ass. Plain and Simple. It *SHOULD* be a right click export, but no, it’s complicated.</description>

      <description>October is a very special month at Ludum Dare. Here’s a post I just did on Gamasutra blogs.
 Hey! I’m Mike, an Independent Game Developer up in Canada, and one of the main people behind the Ludum Dare Online Game Jam event. I’m here to invite you to participate in a very special event we’re running this month, The October Challenge.
The Challenge isn’t your typical game jam, but the rules are simple:</description>

      <description>Progress on the tech for my upcoming game “Alone, The” has been a little slow the past couple weeks, due to Ludum Dare, a nightmare of server issues (both LD and my own), and my upcoming move (OMG THAT’S RIGHT NOW). I have some great news to share though:

      <title>AppDailySales, and running on Synology NAS Devices</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2011/08/23/appdailysales-and-running-on-synology-nas-devices/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2011 23:59:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2011/08/23/appdailysales-and-running-on-synology-nas-devices/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/002.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Continuing &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2011/08/23/i-am-running-a-synology-nas-now/&#34;&gt;my prior post&lt;/a&gt; where I talk about my server replacement, a Synology NAS (DS211j). In essence, a cheap, tiny dedicated Linux box featuring an ARM CPU and custom web UI specially designed for SUPER EASY RAID array maintenance and creation. There’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS411j&amp;amp;lang=enu&#34;&gt;a 4 drive version&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/index.php?lang=enu&#34;&gt;many-more drive&lt;/a&gt; versions, but they cost more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I’m here to talk about a little tool for getting your daily sales data from Apple’s iTunes Connect website. &lt;strong&gt;AppDailySales&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/&#34;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a python script I was recommended some months back, but it needed a few things IMO. So in a shocking rare case of OSS justice, I added the features I wanted myself and submitted a patch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/issues/detail?id=31&amp;amp;can=1&#34;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/issues/detail?id=31&amp;amp;can=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago (nine months later), version 2.9 was released (sparked by Apple’s change to the system), now including my patches! 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the script, all you need is Python. Before I used to run this on Windows XP (Python installed in C:\Python2.7, with PATH environment variable set to include this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the NAS, I SSH in to the device (Go download Putty if on Windows), login as root (same password as admin), and install the python package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ipkg install python&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the AppDailySales.py script somewhere on your computer, likely in the same folder you want your stats placed. Then simply invoke it with –help to get a list of arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python appdailysales.py --help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run it from a batch file or script. My old Batch File Version looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new, shockingly similar shell script version (i.e. only single %’s) is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates files like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-13.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-12.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-11.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-10.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice and easy to read names, unlike the default files generated by iTunes Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next section, I’ll talk more about setting it up as a service. In other words, totally automated!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2006/10/07/new-server-aka-i-killed-a-cisco/&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last week, a drive &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2006/10/07/new-server-aka-i-killed-a-cisco/&#34;&gt;in my server died&lt;/a&gt;. These drives weren’t really that old, but were Seagate’s from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1050374/seagate-barracuda-7200-drives-failing&#34;&gt;drive failing epidemic&lt;/a&gt; a few years back. I bought 6 drives around this time, 4 for the server in a RAID 10 array, 2 for my workstation. I lost 1 to the failure problem, and the rest I managed to get updated firmwares installed in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have been extremely leery of Seagate drives. My server ran Windows XP (yes), and used the on-board Intel SATA RAID controller of this MOBO. On several occasions, the RAID integrity would fail for no good reason upon bootup, that I simply stopped turning my server off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother the “professional network admin” has been reminding me for years that Software Linux RAID is the best RAID. So after this tragic failure (no data lost, just some hair), it was time for something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I have been talking NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices for a while, he himself trying a few over the years, to really sub-par results. Generally, the prices were terrible for completely sub par hardware that couldn’t perform. Popular NAS like the Drobo start at like $700, yuck! The best bang for buck always seemed to be building a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, bang for buck wise, building your own file server is still cheaper. But Linux is a delicate mistress. I am a coder, and dealing with game console development tools and Linux setups over the years has taught me how to live comfortably in Linux. I work on Windows though, just I do it with Cygwin and MinGW/MSys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, there is still too much sh*t to learn about Linux. Time is money. Building and maintaining another server, I’ll be honest, I don’t want to do it (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freenas.org/&#34;&gt;FreeNAS&lt;/a&gt; was suggested on my Twitter, for anyone in a more adventurous mood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 2011, give me a drop in solution that’s cheap, small, fast and good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_20110823_214643.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blam!&lt;/strong&gt; Hello &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS211j&amp;amp;lang=enu&#34;&gt;Synology DS211j&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 2 drive consumer model rakes in at around $200, size not much larger than an eternal casing, and sporting a 1.2 GHz ARM processor. ARM! Hey! I know those!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs a breed of Linux, interfaces via gorgeous fast HTML UI, and support fancy Linux favorites like SSH out-of-the-box. Well not quite out-of-the-box, as you do need to download the latest firmware and a setup tool for your OS, but that’s easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine I filed with a pair of 3TB Hitachi Deskstar drives, spinning at 7200 RPMS with 64 MB of cache. Western Digital Caviar Green drives were $40 cheaper each, but are known to be slow and problematic on RAIDs (though there are fixes, a tool WDidle3 seems to address this). Again, time is da mon-nay, and wanted something I could just drop in. Benchmarks said these drives were better overall performers too, so hey, why not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/002.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hardware setup was a matter of unboxing, opening it (sliding case sides front and back to unlock), plugging my drives in, screwing them in, and closing the casing (opposite of opening). I think I had this done in 5 minutes, max. Didn’t even need a manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the array I wanted (MODE 1) was extremely straightforward, that I wont both talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I will talk about is some of the advanced stuff I wanted from it, and the configuring done to make it act accordingly. After all, this blog post is actually for me, so I can know what I did in case I need to reproduce it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Journey to Live Coding</title>

      <description>This past couple weeks I’ve been busily working on architecting many little things (super important things) for my new game. One of the big things I really didn’t set out to do initially, but once I realized my efforts were converging there, I decided to make it a priority: Live Coding.
I am using a scripting language Squirrel to handle the gameplay side of the programming. This is new for me, having hardcoded or written my own sub-par scripting and data entry dialects to make my prior games.</description>

      <title>Premake: My new best friend (RE: MSVC &amp;#038; Xcode)</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2011/07/31/premake-my-new-best-friend-re-msvc-xcode/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2011 22:19:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2011/07/31/premake-my-new-best-friend-re-msvc-xcode/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, I’ve spammed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mikekasprzak&#34;&gt;twitterverse&lt;/a&gt; enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s something I &lt;strong&gt;started&lt;/strong&gt; playing with today, and &lt;strong&gt;finished&lt;/strong&gt; just a few hours later, satisfied. &lt;a href=&#34;http://industriousone.com/premake&#34;&gt;Premake&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, it’s a build script and project file maker, just like CMake and Scons. It uses Lua scripting, to contrast custom and python for the others (CMake a Scons respectfully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren’t me, you could save yourself a slew of portability headaches with this simple script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(From &lt;a href=&#34;http://industriousone.com/post/typical-c-project-0&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick that in a folder with code, or code found in some directories. Then from a command-line, invoke the tool &lt;strong&gt;premake4&lt;/strong&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;premake4 --file=myfile.lua vs2008&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blam! Your prize, a Visual Studio 2008 project file and solution. Want 2010? Just change the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want it building elsewhere? Walk over to your Linux box, or your Cygwin/MinGW shell, and do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;premake4 --file=myfile.lua gmake&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have a makefile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, anyone that’s done project management knows that the above is just your most basic of projects. Standard C/C++ libraries, and whatnot. Per platform you still need to link versus external libraries (OpenGL, SDL, etc). No problem, just add new sections to your targets. includedirs, libs, libdirs, and so on. Want to apply a setting to both? just place it a level up in the hierarchy. Nearly everything you would normally do on a platform, there’s a means of adding content to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there’s little point having me regurgitate how to start using it, as the docs have a wonderful tutorial that steps through it. And once you get to the files stage of the tutorial, you can generate a usable project file with just that. Here’s the link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://industriousone.com/solutions-and-projects&#34;&gt;http://industriousone.com/solutions-and-projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one last tip though, is that the scripting interface is doing some housekeeping behind the scenes. The functions Solution, Project, and Configuration specifically. Calling them changes the scope of the calls that follow. This is important to note if you try to use normal Lua scripting activities, a “printf” will write to the console as the project is generated, but not while it runs. There’s a command for setting the actions at each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you can invoke &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171452%28v=vs.90%29.aspx&#34;&gt;MSBUILD&lt;/a&gt; from the command-line if you want to live in shell land (like me). Start a Visual Studio 2008 shell (under Start Menu/Visual Studio 2008/Visual Studio Tools/..), then browse to and invoke it as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;msbuild MySolution.sln /property:Configuration=Debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And presto. Your actual errors will be logged to the console window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hey, ahem, back on topic. If you’re not me, you can use something like this to do your project management work. I however have and REALLY LIKE a fancy GNU make based build system I wrote. Unfortunately, this only helps me when I’m developing for Windows, Linux, and certain devices. It does no good when I am actually required to use Visual Studio (certain libraries, DRM, SDK’s), or Xcode on Mac. But that’s where Premake comes in, to take care of that stuff for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some wild plans ahead, but I wanted my original working script available somewhere. Hit the jump for the full listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, it’s Lua, so double dashes are line comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Smiles has wrapped, so yes sir, I am working on my new game. Let the AWESOME begin!
Today I plowed through the massive task of finishing the redesign of my new build system, and moved the WIP game code over to it’s lovely new home. Lots of work, not much to show (at least, not in the mood to show yet).
But hey, I have this other thing.
Yesterday I received a Hydra motion controller from Razer in the mail.</description>

The first is a response to a topic of inspiration posed by Andy Moore. I try to get out for walks as often as I can, and I bring with me a camera phone… here’s what I see:
Next was something from this past weekend. I picked up an iCade, which is an arcade controller for an iPad, and I got it working with something NOT an iPad.</description>

      <description>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about… well… yeah, it’s actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of “big games are extremely risky”, despite doing one myself right now.
I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures.</description>

      <description>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I’ve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I’ve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of “talking to a wall”.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a new laptop (Lenovo X220) and made some upgrades (160 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM) making it a great little development machine. I like it so much, that I want to use it even for my Linux needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to do a post or series of posts whenever I do a notable Linux install, often because there are so many nuances you need to deal with that are easy to forget.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I did miss my June 23rd target date, but with good reason: I started on computer upgrades and setting up my new Laptop early. 😀
But yes, as you approach the end of something, there are always things you forget about that still need to be done.
Like this, a Computer and TV-System appropriate trailer for Smiles HD (i.e. without entire screen rotating):
As you can see, that is now done.</description>

      <description>Yes, you read that right. It is ending. For real.
June 23rd is the 3 year anniversary of Smiles (as in, starting the game). I have finished every single port of the game that I had planned on doing (except console ports, both I decided to abort); Some are still in submission or need of final packaging. Days away now.
Today is June 15th, a whole week away from the anniversary.</description>

      <description>Speaking of better, here’s the final gameplay trailer for Kindle Smiles:
That is submitted and in the queue now. Should be available in the Amazon Kindle store soon.
BONUS!
I recorded a brief “making-of” video, showing how recording the footage for the above video would look.
Now that Smiles is finally winding down, I’m hoping to do more little things like this.</description>

      <description>Hey, well that didn’t work. Smiles for WP7 after a couple weeks.
Or according to my data: 9 trial downloads, and 1 sale since. There was some twitter talking, some retweets by fellow devs, but there’s practically no noticeable spike.
Ah well, so much for that. On to bigger better things.</description>

      <description>Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my “Microsoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account” yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.
I made this game (Smiles), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:
It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?</description>

      <description>Looks like the Symbian^3 versions of the game went live this morning in the Ovi store.
A 5-star positive review of both games so far. Excellent!
I’m writing up a nice long post (to follow) about the new game. Hopefully finished soon.</description>

https://market.android.com/developer?pub=Sykhronics+Entertainment
To say the Android port has was the most requested would be an understatement. I sent messages to the list of starred people in my e-mailbox, everyone that ever asked about the Android version… I hope I got everyone. It feels good to finally have this covered. Ahhh!
There are 2 versions of the game available. Content wise they’re totally the same, but the difference is as follows:</description>

      <description>I’ve been making games for a really long time now, but one thing I’ve found myself rather resilient to was letting myself use Middleware. By Middleware, I mean 3rd party libraries. It’s funny since I always highly recommend that people use it (to save RIDICULOUS amounts of time), but I myself am just a really slow adopter of it.
SDL is one of few long-time 3rd party libraries I use. It lets me write my game code against the PC, Mac, Linux, and a few mobiles including Palm/HP’s webOS and Nokia’s Maemo.</description>

      <description>Happy April 1st!
To start, my thing to make you laugh.
I’ll be finishing this up in the coming weeks. I had to prioritize some stuff ahead of it due at the end March (another reason I’ve been so quiet post GDC). There was also a faux pas on my part, but nothing too big… I just have to drive down to the US border and activate a 2nd gen Kindle.</description>

      <description>It’s mid-day Saturday. I’m on a plane in less than 20 hours bound for San Francisco, to join the celebration that is GDC (the Game Developer’s Conference).
It’s a packed week for me. The past couple years I attended back-to-back Indie Game Summit talks on Monday+Tuesday, but this year I’m planning to jump around a bit more. My iPod touch calendar is filled with the most interesting talks that my Summits pass will let me in to, including some Wednesday-&amp;gt;Friday.</description>

      <description>2011 is here! The IGF finalists have been announced, CES is upon us, and GDC is less than 2 months away. I always have a hard time following up epic posts like the last one. So with this, my third attempt (ahem), I’m going to try to be more to the point: My plans for the year.
First, the Mac App Store launches on Thursday… I wonder if Mike did something for that?</description>

      <description>The exact timing is a little off, but I today just renewed my business license.
Yes, 5 years ago July I left my job as Technical Director at Big Blue Bubble (now one of Canada’s largest game studios … you’re welcome ;)). Here’s what I had to say.
 All systems are go!

      <description>Added a toggle button for Windowed and Fullscreen today, and made it actually work. I also did some tweaking of the icons around the edge of the screen (pushed them higher, made the outlines more consistent).
The About/Credits screen icon is now a speech bubble (was a “?”, so not to confuse it with the help menu). Just a few more tweaks to go before I dive in to Android.</description>

      <description>I am a regular twitter user. I run a client (twhirl) in the corner of my right monitor, so for me it works like a weird combination of an IM client and RSS reader.
A couple days ago, I caught glance of this request from Noel Llopis (developer of Flower Garden, Dr. Seuss’ Lorax Garden, and the upcoming Casey’s Contraptions).
That’s a good question. As far as I know there’s no real “standard” achievement sound (unless you want to rip-off Microsoft).</description>

      <description>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It’s been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me — I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I’m there.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, I was inspired to start playing with logo designs. There’s no new decisions to be seen here in this post, just some ideas I’m playing with (and rejecting).
I actually used to make my own typography and font designs, one such example is this:
You can see more examples of prior logos here.
For the past 5 years I’ve been using this:

      <title>Smiles in 64 bits</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2010/11/13/smiles-in-64-bits/</link>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2010/11/13/smiles-in-64-bits/</guid>
      <description>So I spent the evening getting Smiles working in 64bit Linux (Ubuntu 10.10) as well as the Mac. Here are the results:
And the Mac again:
And a closeup of the processes section:
Getting it working on the Mac wasn’t really necessary, but I really like Xcode’s debugging tools. They made tracing the issue very straightforward. I had two VNC windows going almost constantly, as I’d make changes on the Workstation PC, commit to SVN, and sync on both the Mac and the Zotac.</description>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2010/11/12/ubuntu-on-the-zotac/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the meat of this post, last night I finished my “early” Mac App Store TODO list. I *COULD* submit it now, but there’s a bug with submissions. My iPad version is called Smiles HD, and so will be the Mac App Store version. Right now the names conflict, so I have to wait until this is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now it’s “done”. I sent the binary to some friends to double-check compatibility. So while I wait, it’s time to get on other ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, my Mac binary is only a 32bit Intel binary. My source &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; compile in 64bit mode, but runs in to issues. Smiles isn’t a game that needs 64bit addressing, but unlike Windows and OSX, 64bit Linux doesn’t support 32bit applications (not stock at least). So one of my next portability challenges is making my Smiles codebase support 64bit Intel and AMD chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from my Workstation PC and Macs, I have a lot of Netbooks. The Netbooks are what I usually use for Linux development. Unfortunately, all the Netbooks I currently have don’t support 64bit instructions (the current generation Intel Atom CPU’s do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ordered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zotacusa.com/zotac-mag-hd-nd01.html&#34;&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Zotac MAG&lt;/strong&gt; Nettop PC. For about $250 CAD (with a rebate), it’s a dual core Atom 330 running at 1.6 GHz, 2 GB of RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, with an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Ion&#34;&gt;NVidia ION&lt;/a&gt; chipset (GeForce 9400M). I’m technically lacking an AMD and ATI test machine, but I do have one of each elsewhere I can turn to if I run in to problems (both running Windows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version I ordered isn’t the most up to date (original NVidia ION, last year’s Dual Core Atom), which is on purpose. This is both a development and a test machine, and if I can buy one for $250, so will other people looking for a low cost PC… not that an NVidia 9400M is anything to shake a stick at either. This gives me a good cross section of graphics hardware I can test in Linux (Intel GMA on the Netbooks, NVidia on the Nettop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I purchased my first Netbook a couple years back (an Acer Aspire One), I started a secondary blog where I recorded all my setup notes, thoughts, and learnings (new word!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s an extra little blog I created to share the super technical and super nuance details of a little project of mine. Turning a stock 8GB SSD Acer Aspire One running Linpus Linux in to an ideal lightweight coding machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything, it was a blog about me learning to use Linux for development. I know a lot more about working inside Linux now, but posts of mine like this I found extremely helpful when I started doing things like Moblin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/2008/10/intalling-console-applications.html&#34;&gt;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/2008/10/intalling-console-applications.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the remainder of this blog post will be me walking through the setup steps taken to set up this new machine for development, and get my 32bit makefile running and building code. In retrospect, the recorded setup details should be identical no matter the CPU architecture (32bit or 64bit, though this was me doing it 64bit style).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Not much to say or show, just that the performance problem was due to the textures being larger than the texture cache.
As it is now, on my Mac mini the game runs at under 8% CPU usage in the menus and Zen, and under 10% in Drop. The largest texture is 1024×1024, DXT5 compressed (4:1, or 1 MB). Before it was 1024×1024 uncompressed 32bit RGBA (1:1, or 4 MB). That either means the GMA 950 in these older Mac’s has 1 MB of cache, or perhaps 2 MB (I didn’t check with 16bit RGBA textures, but it’s unlikely).</description>

Yesterday was spent trying to get a 64bit version of Ubuntu running on my Media Center PC (i.e. my old dual core AMD workstation PC, now hooked up to the projector). My initial attempt of installing it to a USB key didn’t work, but I did eventually get it working using WUBI.</description>

      <description>Going through my Smiles HD TODO/Wishlist, one thing I’ve been meaning to add to the game for a long time was a minimize button. The game runs on several multitasking OS’s, but your only option up until now was to exit. Now, if the OS supports it, it can be suspended in to the background with just a click.</description>

      <description>Well alright. I agreed to do a little contract gig back during the summer that finally caught up with me, so the past couple weeks were spent on that. Yesterday we finally finished and submitted that, so I’m free to work on what’s really important: Smiles HD for computers!
Wait… what!?
Okay, well I still do have my new-game scheduling plans detailed in the last post, but I’ll be slightly delaying that start time yet again, but not by much.</description>

      <description>It’s now half way through the month, and progress on my “October Game” is minimal to say the least. I suppose that was to be expected, since I did have several things to finish this month. My week-days have been filled with various tasks, leaving only weekends to work on this new thing. Next week I’ll be busy with my “1 more thing”, leaving me the last week of October for a final crunch.</description>

      <description>Since the summer I’ve been chatting with Microsoft about bringing Smiles to Windows Phone 7.
In early September, I was invited to an event “Windows Phone 7 Blogger Night” in Toronto.

In addition, I make a brief appearance in this video.

Heh, this might be one of my worst appearances on video (Mr. Shiny forehead), but fortunately it’s very quick.</description>

      <description>So here’s that news: Smiles is coming to Windows Phone 7!
Here’s proof.
And here’s a snap of the game running on a completely different Windows Phone device, an LG.
I love it when code runs on many different devices. 🙂</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Busy busy. I didn’t get to put much time in to the October game this week, but their certainly was progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing my daily logs over at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/&#34;&gt;Ludum Dare site&lt;/a&gt;, to try and encourage more people to participate there. I’ve really only worked on the game for 2 days, despite my plans to start early. Today I was busy with &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt;, so this week’s update will be light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “week” was about getting the foundation of editor up and running. Currently it works on a 2 button mouse (right click to erase), but the editing interface will support a touch screen (tile zero is the eraser). There’s currently no UI, but I can cycle tiles with the mouse wheel. It auto saves/loads the map to a specific file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started out looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PoVGame03.png&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then by the end of the night Saturday, it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PoVGame07.png&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested at all in the process from A to B, hit the jump for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; going to do some work today (Sunday), but there’s so little time left, I’m calling it a night early.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The response to the October Challenge has been incredible! I think the one thing that’s most amazing about it: everybody gets it. Every appearance of it on the internet has encouraged a plethora of “I’m in!” or “It’s ON like Donkey Kong!” responses. I’ve had dozens of direct tweets and people hunt me down in IRC just to tell me how much they love the idea. Very awesome!
For October 1st, I’ll be setting up and doing a new post on the Ludum Dare site, explaining how we can keep a list of finished games (i.</description>

      <description>You might think I’m contractually obligated to start something ridiculous every few years, though I don’t remember signing the papers.
My new project is awesome, I love it, but it’s going to take me all of next year (and maybe more) to make it. I’m so fascinated and taken by it, it’s something I NEED to make. But that’s next years agenda.
This year, 2010, there’s still a good 3 months left.</description>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2010/07/31/a-rough-appup-porting-guide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the items on my &lt;em&gt;seemingly infinite&lt;/em&gt; TODO list is to write an article about how to port an iPhone game to AppUp. Another item is to rework my blog layout and list all the actually useful content written here. I’ve yet to do either, but I think I have here a good compromise for the 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do a-lot of emailing, and this past week I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lazy8studios.com/&#34;&gt;had a chat with a fellow developer&lt;/a&gt; who wanted some advice on porting his game. I sometimes forget about the hours of work that went in to figuring out the the right combination of Unix tools, Windows tools, cross platform libraries, and how to smash them together until they make something that actually works. So I sent him a very &lt;em&gt;to the point&lt;/em&gt; list of things that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime after that, I realized I should just post that e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Towlr recently frustrated attendees at “N Design”, an art-game exhibit in Curitiba, Brazil. Very cool!
Here are some photos of the event.
Several other favorites were at the event, included a Rohrer game, a Terry Cavanagh game, and of course, Braid.

      <description>Somewhere on my agenda is writing up some articles on how to port from iPhone to some of the other cool platforms out there (PC/AppUp, Palm, etc). I’m always rather busy though, when I finish one thing I’m often on to the next one.
I have numerous developer friends I regularly chat with on IRC, Forums and e-mail, since we tend to be doing the same things with our games (porting, marketing, etc).</description>

      <description>Not much to say… okay, maybe there is, but I don’t want dwell on it.
A random work in progress shot, showing the result of terrain generation, and an imported 3D model. No, this isn’t a game, just showing that I’m working with some 3D stuff right now.
I’m back working on some Smiles stuff again right now, which I’ll post about in the coming days as I finish. Plus, Ludum Dare 18 is next month, so I have some work to do there as well.</description>

      <title>The final mobile port (for now)</title>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2010/06/05/the-final-mobile-port-for-now/</guid>
      <description>I actually finished on Sunday, but the final mobile port of Smiles is now sent. The port is for Samsung’s Bada mobile platform. I was pleasantly surprised how straight forward it was to get things up and running there. The system API is very much like a C++ version of Apple’s ObjC iPhoneOS API. The whole endeavor took no more than 4 days worth of work.
So done!
I will continue to support the existing plethora of ports as needed, but now it’s time to switch gears, and get going on the new project!</description>

      <description>So finally, Smiles 1.1 for Netbooks (The Intel AppUp Center) has been submitted. Also, though Moblin Netbook Smiles was submitted last week, it came back with a very minor issue. That is now fixed, and sent as well. So Netbook Smiles == all done.
I have 1 last mobile port I’m doing, Samsung Bada. Again, Google wont let Canadians make Google Checkout Merchant accounts, so Android and NACL Smiles ports will be pending that, and a good motivator for each.</description>

      <description>The latest in the seemingly endless stream of ports (the first of the two implied quicker ports I’m doing… though the 2nd one is sounding not so quick after all).
The N900 is a Linux (Maemo) based device, so I was literally able to pick up where I finished the Moblin (Linux) ports.
Admittedly, it was a bit of a scary port, since I was only initially able to get the game to do about 10 fps.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m kicking myself for not doing this with some of the other platforms I’ve ported to recently (or I will be kicking), so I’ve decided to quickly scribble down some notes while the process is still fresh in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Heh, I certainly wasn’t expecting this.
RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I’m now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I’ve been using UltraVNC on my PC’s recently, though I do run their iPhone client. 😉
Thanks for the tip Adam.

I FINALLY submitted my Moblin (Linux) AppUp port of Smiles late last night.</description>

So to make that happen, I need to power through my list of pending platforms I want to cover, before back-burner’ing the rest.</description>

Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‘eh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).
The past week I’ve been busy with a variety of things.</description>

      <description>One of the sessions I saw at GDC this year was Palm’s talk about their new PDK (i.e. their native SDK). The promise was a Linux based mobile device featuring SDL and OpenGL ES. Since my Windows and Linux code base also uses SDL and OpenGL, that certainly caught my attention. In theory, all I need to do is just recompile my Linux version with their tools and I’m done, right?</description>

      <description>And it’s that time again too. Ludum Dare #17 is coming up next weekend. If the idea of crunching together a game from scratch in 48 hours interests you, check us out.
Now, this compo has been a little different. We announced our date nice and early, so the people at GDC would know about it, and to save us from silly “when will the compo be?” questions. So really, it was probably our best pre-announcement for a compo date to date.</description>

      <description>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel’s AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement.</description>

      <description>I’m actually in the middle of a rather large post, but I still felt this was worth noting (while inappropriate for the other post). PuffBOMB, my explosive little freeware game is currently featured on GameJolt.

GameJolt is a unique games website that’s a bit like a “Kongregate” for freeware. I put PuffBOMB up there some time last week to try it out, and it’s pretty cool.
The site has a neat feature for downloading and playing PC games right from the browser.</description>

      <description>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I’ll talk a little more about the “day 1 FREE” experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn’t going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device.</description>

I couldn’t have asked for a better way to end the night. Thanks everyone! Keep spreading the word, and have fun with Smiles HD on your iPads!
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smiles-hd/id364871736?mt=8
Remember: Smiles HD is FREE *ONLY* until the end of the day April 3rd! Regular price, $4.99. I think you’ll agree, it’s worth at least that.</description>

Smiles HD, regular price $4.99 is FREE April 3rd!

At of this writing, I’m #27 in the top games, literally 1 spot below the actual Top 100 Apps. So very close!

      <description>Oh hey. Like literally an hour or two after that big epic blog post of mine, Apple let us know we could submit early. So I crunched the game together and did exactly that.
Here’s some final video footage of the game.</description>

      <description>Here’s an early development video of Smiles HD. The video shows a typical game of Drop at the Normal difficulty (typical for me at least).</description>

      <description>Alright! The iPad is coming soon, as is a brand new version of Smiles.
As we speak I’m putting the finishing touches on Smiles HD, the all new higher resolution and slightly redesigned iPhone game coming soon to the iPad.
Now, in the eyes of Apple I’m nobody special. So like many of you, I’ll be heading down to my local Apple store on launch day to pick me up an iPad… with one slight difference.</description>

      <description>So, holy cow! GDC was absolutely insane! I almost don’t know where to start, but lets start from the beginning.
First thing first, I won again!!
Yes, as if winning a free car wasn’t enough, I also won a free trip to GDC. So Intel ended up covering my flight, putting me up in a fancy hotel, gave me some spending money, treating me to dinner, AND giving me nearly front row seats to a San Jose Sharks hockey game!</description>

      <description>For the benefit of friends and people I’m meeting at the show, here’s a run down of my itinerary for GDC. I’ll also be tweeting and watching twitter while I’m down for any impromptu meets, hang-outs, and whatever with people I know. If the twitter says “totally bored”, then you know. 🙂
If anybody I know needs my cell number, send me a quick e-mail (mike AT sykhronics dot com). It’s not my usual cell, but it’ll be my number whilst I’m in San Fran.</description>

      <description>Ordinarily, greeting someone by glancing at their chest might be seen as a little rude (especially a lady), but at GDC it’s encouraged! Yes I’m talking about the passes, not making a pass.
The passes do a good job of helping you connect a face to a name, and even a company, but you don’t always know who made or represents what. GDC passes include a relatively large pocket, so you could either make something to insert behind your name card, or cover the pass with some strategically placed stickers.</description>

      <title>A Very Different GDC (for me)</title>

      <description>So last year, I was an IGF Mobile finalist. This little game of mine stood alongside iPhone favorites like Edge and Fieldrunners, vying for the “Best Mobile Game” award. And if I had won, … well, I have no idea. Even just being a finalist has been great for me, so I’d image it would have been MORE great. 😉
That was 2009, and this is 2010.
This year started out as my “low key” and “quiet” GDC.</description>

      <description>So hey. Back in December I finished up a 1.0 port of Smiles for Netbooks, and sent it to Intel by their early contest deadline.
And hey, guess what?
Link here.
Second place! That’s awesome. 😀
So hey, what does 2nd place actually mean?
Wow. So I guess I’ve got a pretty good story now when mingling at GDC. 😀
I’ll post some photos once it arrives.
Woohoo!</description>

      <description>I’m sure this will surprise no one, but yes I’ll be releasing Smiles HD for iPad.
The iPad port will be based on my current Smiles code running on Netbooks and some Windows Mobile devices (Samsung Omnia II), but I’m in the process of adding several more enhancements on top of that. I’ll dive in to more of the specifics as iPad launch gets closer.
The biggest different between iPhone Smiles and my current code is I’ve squared the playfield (was 9×8, now 8×8) and added rotation buttons.</description>

      <description>As part of Intel’s new AppUp Center launched at CES yesterday, Smiles is now available for select Windows PC’s of the XP and 7 varieties.
http://www.intel.com/consumer/products/appup.htm
The store is very new and beta. It’s designed specifically for Netbooks and the OEMs that make them, but is freely available to for everyone to test and purchase from. Me personally, I had to install .NET 3.5 and .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 on my Aspire One to make it work.</description>

      <description>I know it’s hard to compete with the wake of the IGF Finalists announcement yesterday, but the Ludum Dare 16 winners were announced yesterday too.
Go here for the Top 20:

      <description>So wow. That’s finally it for 2009. Like doing taxes ever year, I feel a special sort of obligation that I write some sort of retrospective, especially after such an eventful year as this one. Far more awesome than taxes. 😉
I wasn’t sure where to start, so I ended up categorizing aspects of the year. I’ll free form rant about each topic as I come to it.

      <description>As the title suggests, I came 4th place with Smiles Zen (in Italian).
I imagine the English versions will be available soon. Samsung’s approval department might be taking xmas off though. 😉

      <description>Well, I can relax now. 🙂
I have the results back from the Samsung contest, but I can’t say how that went … yet. There’s supposed to be a proper winners announcement deal on SamsungApps Thursday, so if I have anything to add, I’ll do it then.
So that’s one thing off my mind.
The other thing off my mind is Intel’s contest. Netbook ports were due today, the same day as the results for Samsung.</description>

      <description>Wow. To say the last 3 weeks have been busy would be an understatement.
First of all, I ported Smiles to a new phone. The Samsung Omnia II, a Windows Mobile phone with a beautiful amoled screen and a custom GPU. Some photos.
For those keeping score, the game unfortunately runs a little slow on the Omnia II. It’s definitely playable, but the GPU is no PowerVR SGX. I did what I could in the time I had, optimized my shaders and all that, but it’s what it is.</description>

      <description>An intense month of work awaits. Crunch time, and then some!
Early/Mid last week, I spec’d out the plan for my time between now and GDC. Quite a busy schedule, with a lot of really cool things coming up. Smiles stuff, and a quick collaboration with a friend, which I’ll talk more about later. I should have plenty to talk about with my internet colleagues in March.
But the icing on the cake was a development Wednesday/Thursday of last week.</description>

      <title>(Annoying) Differences between Visual Studio and GCC</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2009/11/15/annoying-differences-between-visual-studio-and-gcc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, awesome C an C++ language features you’ll learn to love in GCC, that’ll break your heart if you ever have to use Visual Studio. 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a list I collected whilst getting my Smiles PC code to compile with Visual Studio 2008. Most have no equivalent in Visual Studio, but one simply has a slightly different syntax (compatible too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, long and technical. Hit the link if you’re up for the challenge. You’ve been warned. 😀&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visual Studio projects for GCC/MinGW/Xcode coders</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2009/11/14/visual-studio-projects-for-gccmingwxcode-coders/</link>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2009/11/14/visual-studio-projects-for-gccmingwxcode-coders/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things on my blogging TODO list is to show how I work. Many coders find it odd to hear that I work on Windows without Visual Studio, or that I work on the Mac by rarely touching the Mac. Just me, a text editor (a good one), and a bunch of useful scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my current project though (Smiles PC), I’ve run in to a slight brick wall that requires me and my development &lt;em&gt;arch nemesis&lt;/em&gt; to join forces. It’s almost funny, but it’s been about 10 years since I’ve had to touch a Microsoft compiler. Normally I’d be reluctant, but we’re talking a distribution issue here… and that’s how I get paid. 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today’s when I swallow my command line pride and get Smiles building with Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is long, nuanced, technical, and mostly for my own benefit. So if you’re up for an over analysis of Windows Developers &lt;em&gt;favorite&lt;/em&gt; development tool, hit the link.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2009/11/13/ludum-dare-16-announcement/</guid>
      <description>Today we announced the date for Ludum Dare #16. This upcoming December 11th-13th weekend.
Ludum Dare is that other thing I do. Along with Phil, Mike and Seth, we run a community website based around the infamous Ludum Dare competition. Game developers from around the world assemble, pick a theme, and make a game from scratch over the weekend. Then we vote on our favorites.
http://www.ludumdare.com/…/announcing-ludum-dare-16-december-11th-13th-weekend/
Nowadays, we do it 3 times per year, this one being our regular December competition.</description>

      <description>This is not what I’ve been up to all year, but it is what I’m up to right now.
So, let’s introduce the project.
Officially, the project is named Smiles. Specifically though, the project’s working title is Smiles PC. Just as you’d expect, it’s Smiles the iPhone game for PC, Mac and Linux. Actually it’s more than that, but lets stick with this for now.
At it’s core, Smiles PC is about removing the dependencies of the iPhone from the game.</description>

      <description>As planned, Smiles Zen 1.3 and Smiles Drop 1.3 were sent late Friday night (technically 5 AM the next day). I made the mentioned addition of arrows after discovering some people didn’t realize you could click on the icon. Here’s a snap of that from the iPhone build on the PC.
I had some friends look at this screen, and got a good reaction from the “love hearts”, so I made a similar change to free version.</description>

      <description>Here’s something I hope to start doing more often. Technically, I’ve been hoping to actually start all year. Short development video logs.
Today’s video is a demonstration of the cross promotion features in Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop. Inspiration hit last night, and I added something amusing to it I’d thought I’d share.
Both builds should go out tonight. I’ll be adding a pair of arrows beside the icon, just so it’s even clearer that you can click on it right here.</description>

      <description>Smiles 1.3 is already in the Apple queue, but not Zen and Drop yet. Something “new” in 1.3 is that I removed the “how to play music” instructions from the game. This used to be in the upper right corner of the screen. The description used to say you could “double tap” the home button to bring up music playback, but it seems that was wrong on the iPhones and 3rd gen iPods.</description>

  1826 – Saturday October 31st
  1361 – Sunday November 1st
  144 – Monday November 2nd (ended at 1 AM)
 The 29th was a fraction of a day. I flipped the switch roughly around noon, which kicked in about 4 hours later.</description>

      <description>Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the launch of Smiles.
…
Yeah, it’s been that long already.
This weekend I’m giving Smiles Zen away for FREE. Also, I’ve discounting Smiles to $1.99 to reflect the price. I guess that’s how we celebrate 1 year on iPhone. 😉
In other news, Smiles 1.3 is on the way. I discovered a graphics performance bug on the newer iPhones and iPods (SGX), so that is now fixed.</description>

I’ll be writing up a full feature/retrospective for Ludum Dare 15 likely today. Results are up, and we’ve got some bragging to do. 🙂
I also have a big announcement to make soon (in a few weeks, month or so).</description>

      <description>Wow!
Ludum Dare #14’s 123 entries in April was a pretty big deal, but our 15th Ludum Dare in August did a whopping 144! Yikes!
http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview
On the plus side, Phil and I came together and awesome-ified the website. He wrote our all new voting and submission system, and I made the site look new and purty. And when all was said and done, it actually worked! Wow!
It came together the weekend before the competition.</description>

      <title>Smiles on sale for 99 cents</title>

      <description>The title says it all. Finally, after 10 months in the App Store, I’ve decided to try out the infamous 99 cent iPhone price with Smiles.
I sent an early pre-release note to some of the iPhone press, as well as my twitter. So far it’s been picked up by Touch Arcade which is always a good place to start.
I’m hopeful. The new trailer is out there in the wild now, and-a… now we wait.</description>

      <description>Yes yes, I’m awfully quiet. What else is new?
Let me tell you.
First things first, a brand new trailer for Smiles.
Why does Smiles need a new trailer? I’ll tell you when you’re older.
This ended up taking a couple weeks longer than I’d hoped it would (spontaneous summer vacation?), but it’s done. The new trailer combines the tidbits dropped in the last post (mushroom animation, new logo), some gameplay footage, and a nice audio track.</description>

      <description>Been caught up with a number of things. Here’s one I’m rather proud of, an animated Smiles mushroom animation.

Animated in ToonBoom Studio.
Something else, an updated Sykhronics Logo animation.
That one is me goofing off in Sony Vegas.

      <description>First on the agenda, the book is real.

As you can see above, my three complimentary copies showed up in the mail today. Word from the Dread Pirate himself (i.e. Lead Author/Tech Reviewer) is the books should be en route, if not already arriving at book stores all over the place. After all, the guy in Canada got his. 😉

      <description>Crawling out of bed early this morning, I made the weird decision that it’d be a blogging morning. It seems I’ve stockpiled a few interesting things to talk about. I’m nearly ready to start talking about the new project too, but as the title suggests, I’ll be talking about the other stuff today.
First thing on the agenda, Ludum Dare. I wanted to follow up that prior post of mine with a brief finale post.</description>

      <description>Wow!
So, I have no idea what just happened, but Ludum Dare 14 was our biggest yet. With 121 entries from around the world, that’s a-lot!!
From my quick check, the highest we’ve had to date was high 60’s (though I was pretty sure we did an 80 entry compo at one point). *shrugs*
I started on an entry on Saturday, but didn’t get all that far. Friday (besides taxes), I was caught up administrating, making sure the whole thing actually happened.</description>

      <description>Smiles has been available for nearly 6 months in the App Store now. From the stories you may have heard, not all iPhone titles necessarily do well. But if you consider that the game was developed by one person in 4 months, it lives under the charts, and has only 1 Apple mention to it’s name, it’s actually done alright. I’m hardly “rolling in the dough”, but I can make ends meet.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note.
Ludum Dare 14 is this Friday. It’s usually Phil and I that run the compo (with Mike and Seth, and our awesome community of regulars), but IGF Champion and Goat Owner Extreme Phil Hassey is off on his North American Tour next week, leaving me to see if I can remember how to use all his compo scripts. 😉
If you’re not familiar with Ludum Dare, we’re probably the oldest make a game in 48 hours competitions on the internet.</description>

      <description>For GDC, I decided to make a special version of Smiles. On the surface it would look like the Lite version (Free Smiles), except I re-enabled statistic tracking and high scores.
Here is how the visitors at my IGF kiosk did.

Games Played: 131

      <description>Just a few hours ago I could barely move. Nearly crawling my way out of bed to attack the day (ahem… night), after the long flight home.
I’ve since returned to my regular routine of pacing around my studio (i.e. basement), between moments of awe e-mailing and ranting everywhere it seems appropriate (forums, twitter). As I exhausted all those wonderful forms of communication, it seemed to be right time to start the required retrospective post.</description>

      <description>Friday was the short day. Wednesday and Thursday we exhibited 10-6, where Friday was 10-3. Went back to the hotel and vegged that day, before heading back out to hang with the Fantastic Contraption guys.
My neighbors were the Secret Exit guys. I ended up spending a bulk of the show goofing off with Tuukka, an artist on Zen Bound. The Secret Exit guys refer to him as the “prankster” of the bunch.</description>

      <description>First day of exhibiting. I have to say, I’m exhausted. Feet ached, and limped a bit throughout the day, but I loved it.
Here’s a few photos of the completed setup.

And a little closer.

I’m sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale.</description>

      <description>Live from San Fransisco, it’s… me.
As you may or may not have heard, I didn’t win. But that’s alright, I’m still here to exhibit.
We’re sharing booth space with the IGF main competition entrants, which is great. That way, when people come to see the cool IGF games, they’ll find us too. Here’s my slice.

Other cool stuff, Apple put up a page of us IGF Mobile entries. Very awesome.</description>

      <description>I’m back. This time, I’m ready for GDC!
Come take an early look at the madness I’m bringing with me to the conference.
As you can probably guess from the lack of Smiles PC/HD progress posts, I will not be demoing it at the conference. I am still bringing both laptops though. The big one will be doing something else instead.
Enjoy! 🙂</description>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2009/02/28/aspects-of-smiles/</guid>
      <description>The first step with Smiles was to up the art resolution. That way, I could cleanly resize to any resolution below 4x the iPhone (1920×1280).
Unfortunately, double and quadruple iPhone res are not practical resolutions. Double iPhone will work windowed on most desktop LCD and 720p screens (960×640), and quadruple in a window fits on a 30″ Dell or Apple Cinema display, but we could do better.
Also, not all screens are the same shape, but the solution isn’t too difficult.</description>

      <description>Yet another series, but video.
Part 1 of hopefully a few videos of me showing off my IGF preparations. Sinage, computers, etc.
3 weeks left and counting.
A bit roughly put together, but that’s half the point. I didn’t want it to eat up that much time, though it did take me some time to remember how to edit and encode a video (without my software crashing).
It’s no Goo Road to the IGF, but hey.</description>

      <description>Alright, I don’t see a reason not to talk about this publicly. So if I’m a good boy, I’ll be walking through my process of up-scaling, converting, and porting Smiles as it happens. Ideally, I’d like to have the game available for all 3 desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Quickly, Smiles is an IGF Mobile nominated collection of puzzle games for iPhone. You can learn more about the game at smiles-game.</description>

Rebuilt the texture atlas’ for the weather and vegetables tilesets, and resized the majority of the in game assets. 3x’d the iPhone res instead of 4x’d, as that would be far too huge.
Art is large enough for 1080p, but the game needs numerous changes to properly support the new aspect ratio(s).</description>

      <description>Alright, so the clock says it’s Friday now. According to my whiteboard, that’s 29 days before I leave for the Game Developers Conference. Between now and then, I have a few commitments to take care of. Possibly a 2nd draft for my writing engagement, jury (selection?) duty, in addition to IGF preparations. It’s also an important turning point for Smiles as a product and a brand. Lets talk about that.</description>

148 Apps, Slide to Play, and one more site which I wont say because I paid for CPM (number of impressions as opposed to time). 😉

      <description>Yep, it’s been in the pipeline since Saturday. Free Smiles is now available. It gives you both games to try (Zen and Drop).
Zen is the patience game. A unique game that’s like the combination of Solitaire and a Match 3. Free Smiles includes a single puzzle.
Drop is both a relaxing and action puzzler. It’s unique combination of timerless play, with various optional easy twitch gaming features like making multiple matches while other clear, twisting the iPhone, and floaters.</description>

      <description>As the topic suggests, Smiles 1.1 is now available. Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop 1.1 were sent earlier this morning, so they should be available in the coming days.
Made a minor website update, since I didn’t win the “Best Casual Game” award, and to point out I’m in IGF Mobile. IGFM finalists to be announced Monday.
One more little something for Smiles, then back to the scripture.</description>

To start, I’m going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year.</description>

      <title>Physics in Smiles</title>

      <description>At first glance you wouldn’t think a matching game like Smiles would feature physics, but it does. In several places actually.
The most obvious example is the particle effects.
Particles were used when ice and rocks break, and also for the tile clearing effect. The tile would be erased instantly from the board, and a particle would be created in it’s place. The particle would zoom in, slow down, then zoom out with a twist.</description>

      <description>I kept video of some of my more interesting bugs/glitches/oddities in Smiles. Some more silly than others.
The first I want to show is a bug in one of the effects for the game mode Zen. It was supposed to be a “toss a rock in to a pond” water ripple. It didn’t really work as expected.

Here’s what it was supposed to look like. Cool looking, but the problem with this was the effect would make you queasy.</description>

      <description>Rather spontaneously, I decided to put Smiles Drop on sale for New Years.
So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab Smiles Drop for the extremely reasonable price of $1.99 (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy Smiles Zen after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on Smiles. Well… you might save a penny buying separately, but still.</description>

      <description>As the name suggests, I finally upgraded my WordPress, and am now running it off my “personal” hosting (as opposed to the biz hosting).
Unfortunately, I was using a relatively ancient version (2.0.3) that lacks an export feature. The best I’ve been able to do was import the RSS feed. This means I lost all the comments (and my drafts). Ah well.
So now after 3 years, it’s finally redesign time.</description>

      <description>It’s been 2 weeks, and much has happened.
As the topic suggests, Smiles Drop and Smiles Zen are now both available. $2.99 each, or save $1 by getting Smiles ($4.99).
So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out. As for blog content, I’m half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days… and I sorta haven’t gone back to finish the post yet.</description>

      <description>I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, “Smiles Drop”. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.
So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.
Wow… I think I can finally take a weekend off now.</description>

      <description>Part one of my rebellion against the iPhone price drop madness has begun. Smiles Zen, the standalone version of Zen is now sent to Apple.
If everything goes according to plan, it will be released bright and early Tuesday morning. This time, I explicitly set the date.

In other news, a new review.

      <description>London, Ontario, Canada – November 12th, 2008
Sykhronics Entertainment would like to introduce, Smiles. A brand new game now available for iPhone and iPod touch.
Smiles is a collection of 2 great games.
Smiles Drop is an unconventional action puzzle game. Unlike many others, you don’t have to wait to make your next move. In addition, you’re not pressured in to making that move either. Play at your own pace. Make matches, break ice and rocks, twisting and turning your way to higher scores.</description>

      <description>Final version of the Smiles video. It’s the short one again, but with me talking.
Here’s your chance to hear and mock Mike. I’ve been getting a number of positive and amusing comments from the video. Such fun things as that I sound like an Infomercial host, and music sounds like “corporate training music”. Finishing this video has been an incredible hassle. Hard drives dying, frequent reboots, loss of WAV file playback in Windows, and YouTube difficulties.</description>

      <description>So I’m still working diligently to assemble my complete press package. Putting the final touches on that video, writing the press release, e-mails, all that fun stuff.
But as part of my procrastination routine, I’m hitting my usual list of sites. IndieGames, “The Sauce”, etc. And as I get to the iPhone gaming sites, I’m hit with this euphoric stupor.
“Dude! That’s me!”
“Duuuude! All them stars be yellow!”

      <description>Just got back from the grocery store, and got the word. “Ready for Sale“.
http://appshopper.com/games/smiles
Search for “Smiles” and scroll down a bit, or browse the puzzle or strategy categories in iTunes.
Contrary to the description, it’s an Action Puzzler. Lumines/Metoes ‘esc, or Bejeweled on crack.
Thanks to some fancy design kung fu, it’s also what the description says. But that’s a topic all in itself.

As of 7:45 AM this Tuesday October 28th morning, the game is now sent.

Digging through my SVN logs for some stats.
Repository was created on June 22nd, 2008. That’s a total of 4 months and 6 days.
All code, art (except the original TTF font, though I did design and make the logo text), and audio created by me.</description>

      <description>Wow, it’s been so long.
The last game I did TRC for was Atomic Betty, the Gameboy Advance game I worked on before leaving Big Blue Bubble. That would have been some time during July of 2005. That finished up, and I was a free man for August 1st.
By TRC I mean Technical Requirements Checklist. Every platform holder has them, though they sometimes have a different name for them. A TRC is a combination of guidelines.</description>

Should go out to Apple on Monday afternoon. Then probably a week and it’ll be live in the App Store.
I’d have taken a photo, but I’m currently cameraless.

      <description>Yikes, it’s a weekend again already! Sunday too! Ack!
Rule of thumb. When Mike says game will be out in a week or two, assume month. Then assume longer.
Ahem.
There’s always the chance that this mysterious iPhone game may destroy my ‘cred’ as a physics guy. Though, I’ve been doing some fun stuff in it to rectify that.
I’ve found several uses for effects based on verlet and spring physics, even though the game lives in a world of tiles.</description>

      <description>Slightly off topic today. Well, if you’re expecting mystery iPhone game news that is.
The weekend ended up being a little more slack-tastic that I’d hoped. Ludum Dare 12 after all, which always keeps me busy.
With only a couple hours left, I decided I’d throw something together quickly. Well, those couple hours went very well.
With so little time, I obviously couldn’t make anything extravagant. What I ended up with was a game best described as “a game designed to piss you off“.</description>

      <description>I must really enjoy being vague.
Three reasons for this. #1, I’m an ass. #2, The art is going through a major (final) overhaul at the moment. #3, I kinda don’t want my loyal viewer to pre-judge the game yet.
So the obvious answer, yes, it’s an iPhone game. Analysis of the mosaic well tell you a few things about the game, but to my credit, it’s not a clone. It’s a few things, but not a clone.</description>

      <description>August 1st, 2005. Three years ago this Friday. I was a burned out coder that left behind his jobs as Programmer, Senior and Lead Programmer, and eventually Technical Director at various game companies. A dozen handheld, mobile, and console titles to my name. A lifetime of game fascination and experience.
Next, I was starting my own.
Now, I’m not the only one of my former co-workers to do this, and certainly not the only one, but I didn’t want to do it the same as we’ve done before.</description>

So… maybe July. *sigh*

      <description>I’ll get back to the series eventually. I was expecting to work and talk about new engine stuffs. Between some spontaneous stuff, taxes, and a week of illness, I’ve not touched anything “next” since early last month.
In other news, Ludum Dare 11 is this Friday. I’ve been too busy to really get involved, but Phil’s got things under control. Notice went out to the mailing list a good month or so early, and I’ve been mirroring the posts on a very default looking gamecompo.</description>

      <description>Ballistic Force wasn’t a long project, but development was dense.
Early on, I attempted a poorly conceived idea of creating densely constructed particle landscape. I wanted a system sort of like molecular/planetary attraction to keep scenery together, and allow clumping like a cartoon snowball rolling down a hill. It might have worked on something highly parallel like a GPU or the PS3’s SPE’s, but my design really wasn’t well thought out.</description>

      <description>This next engines name and story is a little complicated.
Game development became a constant burn out for me. Since finishing Secret Agent Barbie (Gameboy Advance) and Polly Pocket (Gameboy Advance), it became clear to me the only thing keeping me going was my fascination with new platforms. Certainly not the subject matter.
After we finished Polly Pocket, I asked for a month off to deal with my burn out. However, we quickly picked up a new game, Barbie: Gotta Have Games (Playstation).</description>

      <description>Over the years, I’ve given names to game engines I’ve worked on. Most of my professional experience has been working on platformers and mini-game collections. Mini-games rarely share much in common, so by engines I’m referring to platformers, or engines for games very much like platformers.
I’d like to start talking about what I’ve been thinking about whilst designing my next engine. I need to set some context though, so I’ll be walking through some of more significant engines I’ve worked on.</description>

      <description>February 29th! How could I not say something today.
Just what to say is the question.
Blogging in the past, I’ve noticed the tendency to want to turn the blog in to something. A community, articles and subjects, talk-back, and all that stuff. And that’s great and all, but it’s a lot of work for not much return. Traditionally to make ends meet this way, you plaster your blog with advertisements, or actively soliciting contract work.</description>

      <description>Start the year right ‘eh?
I think each year I’ve had a blog, I’ve told myself “Yes sir! This year we’re going to blog more often… and it’s going to be great!”.
I’m not crazy enough to think that’s going to happen, but there’s always the intent. – – – –
Some fun code I toyed with over the past couple weeks, completely unrelated to each other. The VST SDK (audio instrument/effects) and the WinTab SDK (tablets).</description>

      <description>Yeah, sorry. I wanted to do detailed commentary of The Spider stuffs, the in between stuff, and get in to the new PuffBOMB stuff, but it looks like it didn’t happen. I wrote an outline and drafted a couple parts, but I wasn’t happy with the results.
“New PuffBOMB” has been down to just me since October. The artist finished his work, which turned out great. Richard got a job, and has been unavailable to help since.</description>

      <description>Before starting work on “The Spider”, I was building the engine for the “new PuffBOMB”. The concept behind the engine, 2D characters and physics, 3D backgrounds styled to look 2D, HD ready. Pretty standard stuff.
The concept behind “The Spider” is, unlike a normal platformer where you stand on the ground, this one you wouldn’t. Instead you would hang from and move along ceilings. The best idea I had at the time for pulling it off was something I nicknamed “double ropes”, one to support, and one for action.</description>

      <description>Pestering works. So it’s September now. Last time I gave a *real* update was a year and a half ago. A 7+1 part blog series titled “And the Project”, where I introduced what went in to a concept I called “The Spider”. You can read it here:
Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4
Part 5, Part 6, Part 7, Part “+1″
Well, nearly a year and a half later, as expected a lot has happened.</description>

      <description>The AO games rating seem to be the hot topic as of late, thanks to Rockstar’s Manhunt 2 initially netting the rating. The AO rating is terrible for game, because it excludes you from key retail outlets like Walmart.
But I want to bring your attention to something that’s generally being overlooked by these articles. Films in the same genre as the Manhunt game. Hostel and Saw. Torture films basically. Hey look!</description>

      <description>Wow, and yikes. Time flies. IGF Submission time again. October 1st ‘eh? I should probably enter. shrug
Here’s something interesting.
 The 2008 IGF Main Competition will again be open to all independent developers to submit their games – whether it be on PC, console digital download, Web browser, or other more exotic formats.
 Cool, but doesn’t that have to mean your game is already available/to be available by October?</description>

      <description>Last post talked about the random thoughts I’ve had about how to pull off the rope dynamics in Umihara Kawase, this classic SNES game that drives us all mad. I made some bold suggestions, and decided to try them. After a couple hours of work, while not as complete as I want, it’s far enough along to be able to demonstrate to me if I have a right idea or not.</description>

      <description>Raigan and I have had an extremely brief dialog on in game ropes. It makes sense, for a while we were both doing rope driven games.
Well, due to my failings as a communicator, I sort of just never got back to him. Yet, I absolutely love the topic, and certainly spent much time puzzled by it. Apparently I’ve also made the conscious effort to push my way in to obscurity.</description>

Note: Try to refrain from bombard me with requests yet, ’cause I know a lot of people already like this idea.
cough, I’m in London, Ontario, Canada.A typical game company places 10 or more people under the same roof. Office space rented out at the expense of the company. There’s a management hierarchy, one or more people responsible for business and infrastructure aspects of the company, and an arrangement of programmers, artists, designers, possibly testers and a sound guy.</description>

      <description>The compo is going ahead full force, despite our complete lack of publicity and organization.
The theme is “Build the Level You Play“. In other words, design a game leveraging user creation or user created content, or a game of building. Line Rider, PuffBOMB, The Incredible Machine, and much more. We’ve seen some pretty exciting ideas discussed in IRC, so don’t miss out.

      <description>Yep. It’s coming. Beyond suggesting the date, I’ve been too busy to get really involved, but it’s coming. This might be one of the most last minute LD’s in a couple years, but it should come together.
After all, it’s an April tradition. Visit us on irc.afternet.org in #ludumdare, and start some fires, and help us get things moving.

      <description>I think it’s an important direction and discussion for game design. Sure, as a gamer, I can handle complicated control schemes. I’ve done my time and held my own in hotkey crazy RTS’s, twitch FPS’s, and I can be pretty menacing in Tony Hawk. But most of these games aren’t getting any easier. I don’t even care to finish Tony Hawk’s Project 8, or the Underground games, because the things you need to do at the end are ridiculous.</description>

      <description>An interesting concept for design people. I’m calling them clicking platformers. Everybody’s played Wik, so I wont talk about Wik. This is a game I came across today called Snakey Jake.
Snakey Jake (YouTube Video)
It’s your usual casual game fare as far as graphics and polish are concerned. What I was expecting was a “click on a spot” sort of game and he’ll move to that spot, but it’s actually click on the platform and he’ll move to the nearest place on the platform.</description>

Anyone that’s followed my work probably won’t be miffed by that mean looking first word. But if you stuck around, you stuck around for my work, not my clever name. You probably have your own pronunciation of it too. I’ve certainly heard some interesting ones from telemarketers that whois’d my domains for a phone number.
Lets see if we are thinking the same thing.</description>

      <description>Ranting… I’m sorry. I suppose I’ve been “writing” music with trackers for about 13 years (Scream, Impulse, Modplug, Buzz, Renoise). Alas, my results have been less than satisfactory. I want to take this moment to apologize to everyone I ever recommended trackers to.
Sorry.
Sometime last month I set out to find a better music app. I’d already entered the world of VST’s thanks to Renoise, having put down a big $600 for Colossus.</description>

      <description>Here’s a fun point. Almost everyone works at a desk, but nobody talks about desks. Chairs come up sometimes, especially in discussions about the Aeron chair versus a well made leather, or general sitting ergonomics.
This is an incredibly broad topic that could easily span dozens of blog posts in it’s complexity. Game developers and other media professionals have many needs for their working surface. And depending on how many hats you wear as a developer, you’ve got to fit several monitors, speakers (stereo or surround), input devices (keyboards, mice, tablets, midi interfaces), scanners, printers, and other office friendly objects (fans, phones, paper and supplies) on it.</description>

      <description>This is part of a forum post I made. Classic Mike, going completely off topic and force feeding all the random advice I had saved up.
– – – –
Be sure your input update is written/recorded immediately before the game processes it. In other words, at the end your control interpretation code/handler. That way it can “in theory” reproduce a crash, instead of coming up a frame or two short.</description>

      <title>Testing Methods</title>

      <description>This is from a forum post I made in response to a question on testing methods. A classic Mike random advice assault. This branched off to a series of thoughts on built in game recorders.
– – – –
Free testing methods:
Peer testing has worked well for me, as developers tend to have bizarre PC configurations (multiple monitors, multiple gamepads, etc). There’s also a level of critique a developer can give that goes above and beyond, but you need to be clear and capable of asking for the harshest of critiques.</description>

      <title>Tips for Game Archive Formats</title>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2007/03/16/tips-for-game-archive-formats/</guid>
      <description>From a forum post, a set of bullet point advice on creating a custom archive format.
– – – –
– For terms: Archives are a directory/dictionary/list of filenames with offsets to chunks, and many data chunks (files). Compression comes later.
– Directories and subdirectories are just longer filenames. Unlimited file name length means unlimited directories.
– Padding the start of data chunks to 4 byte boundaries has performance advantages on many platforms when in RAM.</description>

      <description>I think I’ve already posted about this everywhere, except here. If you’re like me, and decided to skip out on Travel, Hotel, and admission to GDC, you can get the meat of the event for a fair $32.
GDC Radio Store
$8 gets you a day (about 6 hours of talks) for either the Indie Games Summit or the Casual Games Summit. Nice. Buy ‘em all for nearly 24 hours of interesting discussions and talks.</description>

      <description>The innovative games arms race is on.
http://gamevideos.com/video/id/9860
… Alright, I give up.
Normally when I see a really fantastic game like this, I’m all excited (Spore). This one drove me in to a brief game design depression. Now that’s emergent gameplay at it’s finest, and I’ve not even played the game.
Concepts like collaborative editing and modern user friendly editing. Two ideas I’ve been extremely excited about toying with. “Oh, we do them both”.</description>

      <description>Sitting in the home office, doing taxes. I came to the realization that the it’s one of those silly short February’s, and I hadn’t posted anything this month. I’ve been doing good as far as posts, with at least 1 thing to say every month. It’d be a shame to break that nice consistent list of dates on the right. Job postings work. We found somebody that seems perfect for the job below.</description>

      <description>I was busy last month cutting together a trailer for… business purposes. I’ll talk more about this later. It turned out surprisingly more difficult that I had have hoped, but I found a rather unique way of pulling it together.
Obviously, the secret weapon is Fraps. Trying to nab constant 60fps footage was doable, but proved tricky, due to my hard drives not being the most defragged. I don’t know how many takes later, I ended up with nearly an hour of game footage, that was cut down to a 4 minute presentation.</description>

Here’s a little job posting that I’ve started to circulate.
[edit] Edited, ’cause it was rather technical and mean sounding. – – – –
Hi there,
We’re looking for a skilled 2D illustrator or animator for a 2 month contract, to start some time in February. The work can be done remotely. This is a full time contract, and I expect it to be on par with industry wages.</description>

Hey,
On the weekend of Jan 26-28 there will be an unofficial Ludum Dare warmup competition.
The compo will be held entirely in #ludumdare on irc.afternet.org. Final entries must be hosted on your own web space. Someone might put up a wiki, but that someone won’t be me – Theme choice will be discussed and voted on Jan 26 at 7pm PST.</description>

      <description>I like Slamdance. I entered PuffBOMB last year, and was a finalist for the casual game award. Since then, I’ve been excited that a more “artful” game competition was beginning to take off. Winners receive a funky ugly dog statuette. Cool! Then a controversial game was pulled. Things are not going well now.
It’s a real shame, and I hope something good comes from the controversy, rather than developing in to more Jack Thompson style heat for our industry.</description>

      <description>It seems I missed the memo.
The 2nd Independent Games compilation was released back in September (25th), and that PuffBOMB game I seem to talk about all the time was included.
As well, there was a set of concept art included in the package. Said art can also be seen right here.
I suppose I should go find a way to acquire a copy, ’cause I’m not sure what happened to a complimentary one.</description>

www.sykhronics.com
It’s not functional, but I think it looks cooler/more professional than before. I’ll make it usable at some later date.
Since it’s a new month, here’s a couple notable images from last month. The first is are a little sketch I did for each of my grandmother’s in their Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>Had a harder time this month scrounging up content unrelated to PuffBOMB I liked.
To be an ass, and to make everybody (else) behind the scenes happy, I’m sitting on this stuff until we’ve pitch it (Mid January is our target). Lots of tweaking and tuning, especially in the art style area. Getting a background look I’m happy with has turned out to be more troublesome than I’d hoped. None the less, the battle rages on.</description>

      <description>You see, what’s fun about big computers is… oh wait… there’s no fun here.
Back sometime in ‘98, whilst I was working in a computer store, my fascination with big computer crap began. And I purchased this massive “Server” case, which was PC’s case for a couple years. Eventually, this behemoth of a case was “promoted” to an actual server, since routine maintenance/upgrades were painful given it’s shear mass.
Then in ‘04, I had the brilliant idea to purchase the biggest, fattest Laptop mankind has ever seen.</description>

      <description>I’m not going to pretend I got lots done. This month got off to a slow start. With Disgaea 2finally hitting our shores, and that inevitable peer pressure to play Oblivion, it seemed like the right thing to do.
But mixed in to a reasonably large game engine re-engineering effort, which always seems to be 2 weeks away from bearing fruit, there’s been my little project of art research or training, or whatever catchy “make art better” phrase I come up with at the time.</description>

The post is of similar quality and length to what I’d normally constitute a “blog post”, so I’m dropping it here so I don’t forget. It’s certainly not a surefire answer to anything, just a stroll through me solving a problem.
The set up: SVN, a great tool for backups, versioning, and synchronization, can and should be used in all aspects of development.</description>

C#

Doing “amazing” things with “PRINT” on the Commodore 64 at the age of 9, and promoting a cheesy Zelda/Final Fantasy hybrid online at 16. Just to give some perspective, the year was 1996, and the game was called Legends of Tidal, a game the Internet has forgotten. Then there was all that game industry experience, but pshaw, nobody cares about that.</description>

      <description>Due to the request of a compilation Classic PuffBOMB will be a part of, I’ve collected various bits of concept art and sketches from 2003 and 2004. Given that the game was a solo effort, and completely dependent on my art skill, it’s no “Art of Warcraft 3″ style giant happy book of fantastic reference doodles. No sir. Instead, it’s just 4 collections of “learner artist” scribbles depicting some sort of character evolution.</description>

      <description>Well, I’m not going to let the month go by without posting something. After all, I have been doing much stuff. Not so much round up, but many many other things.
The project progresses. We’re busy preparing a pitch-able playable of the game that we’ll be pitchely pitching to potential pitch-able people pretty pitching soon. I’ll have less riddles and more to say about that in a few weeks.
Also, I’ve silently (and finally) put together a MacOS X version of PuffBOMB.</description>

A hand full of interesting games this month. Eets, the TIM like game with the hungry mood swing guy; Bone: The Great Cow Race, a fine modern example of comic gone adventure game; Odyssey: Winds of Athena, the game with the water currents gameplay; and American History Lux, desensitizing gamers of war since 1754.</description>

      <description>Yup, I’m a few days behind mentioning this, but this month’s round up is up. A personal favorite of mine, Titan Attacks reigned supreme, followed by the slick steam powered airship game, Steam Brigade, and the un-noted but equally as surprisingly quality Inlay clone, Mosaic: Tomb of Mystery. Fun stuff.
As expected, I’m going to say things are going well with the game, despite the updates. Actually, better than well. Much Biz oriented stuff, which I’m going to have to sit on for a while.</description>

      <description>A condensed version of my previous post seemed to be making the rounds. It’s resulted in several interesting comments and additions from developers and gamers alike. I’ve decided to do your homework, and compile this list. Text in bold are the originals, with my comments in normal type.
Here we go.

      <description>Now that I’ve succeeded in world domination (also known as syndication), I present to you a short list of complaints to fellow developers. 8 ways to make the monthly round-up panel hate you. Unofficial in every way, as it’s just my observations, but toned a tad sarcastic and sharp to get the point across. It’s not for everyone, as we do get a good number of games that work great. But there’s just enough of them to compel me to write this.</description>

      <description>So, that’s what happens on the 91’st day of the year shows up, your name is Mike, and you want to poke fun at casual gaming. You end up with a human body themed match 3, and an outrageous story that I don’t even want to rationalize. And yes, all Mike’s were thinking the exact same thing.
Yeah, this post is a rather plain one. Just a confirmation that yes, that was a joke, and an excuse to do an image dump.</description>

      <description>With mere minutes left before the end of the month (and April fools), I guess now is as good of a time as ever to do an update… At least before someone thinks I’m joking.
Content was put aside earlier in the month, as we finish and fix more important things. Besides, having working tools before we start building anything would make more sense. Speaking of tools…
The Object and Map Editors are functional and working great.</description>

      <description>Thursday, another big day at the Game Developers Conference.
Yesterday had some good events. The IGF results were announced, and the evil forces of Darwinia ran away with most of the prize money. Curse you Darwinia, I will have my revenge! Sony also spilled the beans, announcing a service “like” Xbox Live Arcade, but neglects to invite Indie’s. How rude. And everyone’s talking about Duke Nukem Forever 2.
It’ll be tough to beat a day as grand as yesterday, but today is always looking for a challenge.</description>

      <description>Yep, it’s that time of month. Tell me, what’s round, monthly and up? I shouldn’t have to answer that question.
A pretty light month. A slick little Final Fantasy’esc RPG, Aveyond. An adventure game with this big blue thing and a really long name, Frasse and the Peas of Kekick. Yes, that’s right. An undersea adventure, Joust revisited, a card game, and more at the Tunnel.
Yeah, I’ve been quieter than I had hoped.</description>

      <description>Ahh the Escapist. A fine weekly online publication.
I had the chance to contribute to an interesting conversation, about a world where developing games was illegal, and what you would do. Of course, it’s only appropriate I took the sarcastic “my life is ruined” angle. Allen from the Escapist approved, and posted this.
 Turn to drugs, live on the street and sell myself cheaply to get by.

      <description>Page 50. Two and a half months later.
Sure it’s not front page news (except maybe for here), but it’s a small achievement I like to indulge myself in. Being a coder, I code a lot. Or at least, that’s what I’ve been doing professionally these past 6 years. So, I’m on a mission to improve my art and music skillzorz whilst on my adventures in independent game development. This little burning through a sketchbook challenge has been a constructive one for me.</description>

A Sunset in Stone Which is probably quite warm, despite the cold imagery of anything in stone…… Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, I wanted an epic name to finish my cheesy little series of updates. Then it’s actual updates when they happen!!! Wow! That actually makes this a blog, instead of story time!

      <description>Cream soda kung fu presents, part 6:
The Epic Tales of Hypocrisyism Viewer discretion is advised. So, right now, the current evolution of the character is this said goo blob thing. It shoots these tentacles/appendages out and swings, like any good monkey should.
However, for as long as I’ve been thinking about going with a gooey character, I’d been concerned about the Gishness factor. This “factor” is what I’m calling all the references to Gish.</description>

      <description>Dude! There’s like, this site. And it has something to do with tunnels, or tunneling. Boy, I could tell you stories of tunneling. But they’re so amazing, they’d blow the minds of my 5 readers. The problem is I’d then have to acquire a new reader base. I can’t have that. Especially with the likes of Jack Black and Bob Villa reading. Their fans would kill me.
Right, so the more temporally correct but logically wrong February Round Up is online.</description>

      <description>Hey there sports fans. Our epic saga continues with part 5:
The Character (or I’m a little tea pot why are you reading this sub heading like I have something insightful to say e-i-e-i-o) Last we left our hero, he was an eight legged insect. Now he’s an eight legged insect looking for a job!!!
Now, don’t get me wrong, he’s not a bad guy. You see, it’s not you, it’s me.</description>

      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2006/02/07/and-the-project-part-4/</guid>
      <description>So we have a character, and certain way the physics work. Cool. I want this game out reasonably soon, so that meant I needed to keep things simple. So minimal amounts of non functional stuff and no heavy animation. I don’t have an art team, just me. So the thought was to make the legs dangle and have shots of webbing shoot out.
And sure, this’ll make some nice still shots, but the character was going to be very nonfunctional looking.</description>

      <description>And the legend continues.
Now, a spider would make a rather cool game character. Especially in a game about swinging. So I toyed with some designs, keeping in mind a sphere’ish geometric character, as shown in the collision diagram above. The following are some results of that early concept work.
And a new one for good measure.
But despite the abundance of designs, I was running into a sort of dilemma coming up with some easy ways to make the character functional.</description>

      <description>And now, part 2. This part I’ll call…
Spiderphobia (versus the more correct Arachnophobia. Correctness is wrong) Spiders, spiders, and more spiders. So the game concept I decided to toy with is one I like to call “The Spider”. The concept itself is most similar to the rope platformer Umihara Kawase, a slick game a former employee introduced me to (thanks Gary). In indie land, the closest similar game to that would be Wik.</description>

      <description>And now, what’s been going on.
As mentioned previously, things started out as my long overdue PuffBOMB remake. So, a physics engine was built, based on what I’d learned from various tech demo’s (which I’ll post at a later date). And it did cool stuff.
Good ‘ol verlet physics action. What you can see above is “characters” composed of spheres (circles), connected by springs. Cool stuff. The 3 circle thang is a potential collision model for the PuffBOMB hamster, and the Balloon like thing is exactly that.</description>

      <description>And here we are. Hopefully, it’s the start of a more regular practice. You’ve probably read the brief Manifesto to the right. This was written some 9 months ago. And now, since things are a tad more orderly, it’s time to expand on that.
Sykhronics, pronounced “psi-cron-icks”. A branding of Mike Kasprzak’s independent game works. Established in 1998, replacing my older branding Gamma Flare Games. After bouncing around the gracious hosting of a few friends, I acquired the “dot com” in 2000.</description>

      <description>February the 1st. I’m mere minutes away from missing this chance to post and make the first of this month, yet I prevail. Ha ha!
Hopefully, I’m finally getting my act together. We’re already a month in to 2006, and really I haven’t had much to show. It seems I’ve been in a less than ideal situation up until recently. It’s resolution was equally as not so idealistic, so excuse me as I be vague, until the day we all look back and laugh about it.</description>

      <description>Slamdance was last week. PuffBOMB was a finalist for the PopCap award. A game by the name of Odyssey took the award. Congratz to them. The rest of the results can be found here.
It’s a shame, but I couldn’t make it out this year. That, and I’m still getting things off the ground here at Syko. I had heard from my “contact” there would be some PuffBOMB action at the festival, but so far my search for evidence has come up short.</description>

      <description>Yes, your monthly dose of round uppage is online.
After having many great games these past few round up’s, it was expected things would cool down. This month has some cool stuff, but nothing that’s going to pull a Weird Words or such on you. The Mastermind being my favorite of the month, despite it being depressingly buggy. This followed by the funky physics motorcycle game Motorama, some addiction to Egypt with Egyptian Addiction, and a healthy dose of shooting and space games, and some Arkanoids for good measure.</description>

I’m busy getting things in order on this side of screen. Big year, lots to do. Many sites that need work, and a game development crunch to kick off soon. Stay tuned. Check back every minute. ‘cmon, show my host how much you love it.</description>

So, to make up for it, I’m going to pick my favorites from the last year (December to November’s round up). I’m not going to rate them, just list them. Here we go.

      <description>The roundup for November is up, just in time for the big day December 25th. 10 again this time.
Many good games this month. Land of Legends, the fantasy strategy game in the top spot, followed by the wildlife park simulator Venture Africa, a hardcore space trading sim Flatspace II, an aquarium store simulator Fish Tycoon, and a slick little soccer player simulator New Star Soccer 3. Good stuff.</description>

      <description>I’ve brought with me this horribly bright colored monster to burn your cornea. Hurah!
Right. Things are back and working in the Mike camp. Back to the grind and all. I’ve also recently finished a drawing pad, after slightly over 3 months. Doesn’t sound like much, but looking back it’s been taking me up to a year to fill one up.
So IGF finalists have been announced. Funky. So many great games have been coming out later in the year, I’m not surprised PuffBOMB didn’t place.</description>

      <description>Crud. This’d normally be a good place to stick an image, but that’s the problem.
Tuesday evening, I’m minding my own business playing a game on my laptop, when suspiciously my desktop PC reboots. I thought nothing of it, and continued playing. Several hours later, I’m shutting everything down for the night, and I find the desktop locking up in the Bios detecting the IDE devices. Whatever, we’ll look in to it in the morning.</description>

      <description>Whilst writing my recent post on the updated logo for the business transition of the branding, I was inspired to take a look at the progression of Sykhronics logos over the years. Some of the more recent logos are custom designed fonts, which is something I plan to again some day with the logo.
Kenny Thornton, and the guys at Execute (a long since abandoned group). Kenny was the only one to ever release anything under the branding, so it’s pretty much his.</description>

      <description>There’s been a lot going on, which I’ll go in to in further posts. This one’s on Logos.
Way back in July I dropped a note about some Rejected Logos. I still haven’t decided what I want, but I’ve been back playing the logo making game.
Ahh yes, a smooth graphic design’ish logo. Hurah.
Do I like it? I’m not sure. I’m torn between going with something more cartoony, or including a little face in the logo.</description>

      <description>The round up for October is up, sporting the sexah new look for the Game Tunnel website. This month sees Russell joining the ranks of the illustrious panel, bringing us to 4. It also shows us taking a more reserved 10 game count, which I think we’ll be sticking with moving forward.
So, how was the month? Two games I really liked this month, Weird Worlds and Cute Knight. Just as I said in my review, and as the others agreed, Weird Worlds is great.</description>

      <description>Yep, I died. No, wait.
I’ve been busy pulling a prototype together. I’m afraid I don’t have much to say just yet. I have a pretty ambitious goal to meet by the end of this month, and I’ll gladly talk about it then. I even brought on some help, as I think timing is crucial.
If this works out, we should see some PuffBOMB action in about a year.

      <description>The September Tunneling is up, and extra shiny. It was a light month, so we had to go back, and pick up a few from earlier in the year. Kisses, Zombie Smashers and Heavy Weapon being your older games. Personal favorites for this month would include The Strategist, Virus and The Goat in the Grey Fedora.
Doing the reviews like we do (blind, we don’t see each others scores until we’re all done), I always seem to have a game or two scoring regret.</description>

      <description>I’ve been trying to come up with a 3rd character to go along with the hamster and the robot for PuffBOMB. When I started redesigning the game, I wanted at least a male and a female character, but ended up with 2 males (3 if you count a butch hamster that I’d recently replaced with the robot).
It seems I have something. What you see to the right is a concept for the potted plant girl character.</description>

      <description>Oh don’t be scared baby, I’m still here.
Yes, it seems I’ve been neglecting posting. On the plus side, there’s been some major progress, but equally major distractions. Since apparently leaving a job clearly means “2 month vacation”, there I was back at Big Blue for a week. All was good though. I was asked to help a struggling project meet a milestone, and that seemed to go well. Twas also nice to hang out with the guys there again, a fine group I must say.</description>

      <description>Err… maybe that’s not the most appropriate post title.
Yes, spreading is what we’re doing. Since I’m a nice guy, and since it’s probably a bad idea to wait, I’ve released the supped up classic 2003 PuffBOMB Prototype to the public. A download link can be found at the ‘official’ PuffBOMB homepage, PuffBOMB.com.
Currently it’s only available for Windows. Hopefully, I can have the MacOS X version ready to go soon.</description>

An underwater sequel to Cosmo Bots, a mech 3D shooter War World, Diablo meets Gauntlet in Evil Invasion, and a double dose of cavemen. An alright month. We’ve had better.
But wait! What is this? Bright red, black, orange and blue banners? Oh noes! What could this be? An add campaign for some wacky game? Inconceivable!</description>

      <description>Alright, this was inspired from a game idea I had a few years ago. In the midst of working on my new physics engine, I’ve decided to revisit the idea and noticed an oddity in my design. Balloons.
Balloons are interesting. Unlike most objects in a game situation, they have this odd property of opposing gravity and going up. With that alone, we can do a convincing simulation in a game by consistently giving it an upward force larger than gravity.</description>

      <description>Well, well. The IGF 2006 Entries are now online, and we have a PuffBOMB clone to duel with. Impulse. It appers to be, according to the description, pretty much the same idea. Lets quote.
 Impulse: The player must place bombs and adjust their timers to make a ball hit the goal field. Obstacles, special elements and force fields provide varied levels. An interactive timeline helps controlling the game by jumping to specific times and guarantees a flexible and unique gameplay.</description>

      <description>Hurah! Finally open. Welcome. Come on in and hear me think.
At some point throughout the day I was working. Really, I was; You can trust me. My new (3rd) office whiteboard just arrived this morning. I took the liberty of violating it with some math/physics filth. It seems to be holding up well, which is good, as I expect many more shamefull acts of mathematics to be performed on it.</description>

      <description>Alright, we’ve got a nice backlog of posts to make this blog look meaningful now. I’ll quickly spruce up the logo, and sneak off to some magical forums claiming “Oh! Didn’t I tell you, I have a blog too! I can’t believe it never came up in conversation. Har Har Har”. Yes, it will be brilliant.
A new round up should be on the Tunnel soon. Russell was down in TV land promoting the site on Attack of the Show.</description>

      <description>Apparently I forgot about this. The Slamdance Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition is yet another IGF like compo. I don’t think it’s actually worth any prizes… at least none their publicizing. Either way, I’ve put together a publicity pack for them, and will be sending it off today. A shame that they’re making me pay to enter. Buh.
I think what turned me off about this “way back when” was that the game had to be profitless, but apparently that’s not the case anymore.</description>

      <description>Oh wow, the IGF is getting serious now. A news report on Gamasutra suggested that the IGF hit a record entry high of 117… Which is… many.
Like the dork I am, I’ll be monitoring this stuff. Don’t think this’ll be the last of my IGF rantings, oh no! Mwahaha!
Oh, and I’ve aparently become a big fan of incorrectly linking the IGF. Instead, I’ve found myself linking an equally prestigious organization, The Royal Society for the Relief of Indigent Gentlewomen of Scotland (Fund).</description>

      <description>Hmm, it seems I misplaced this blog post.
With less than 5 hours to spare, it’s in. Excellent. It wasn’t without it’s drama though. Once confirmed by myself, my brother, and a few friends that everything was good, I began to upload. *OH GOOD*, the upload server was acting up! Ack!
Within 20 minutes things cleared up. I snuck my game into it’s folder, hit the switch, and waited as it’s bytes were sucked out of Canada into some server likely in the California area.</description>

Yep. In one sense, I’m ready to go. I filled out the submission for yesterday, and paid my entry fee. Apparently however, you need an installer. *Oh*. So today, after finishing the missing graphics, I got to do that. Huge thanks to Seth for sharing with me his NSIS script, which saved me hours of digging for little things like uninstaller cleanlyness, icon changing, and so many silly little things.</description>

IGF polishing goes well. Just a few more graphics, and some minor updates to the game itself, and we’re good to go.
2 days left. We’re looking good.</description>

      <description>A bit of a last minute scramble to get something together for the IGF. My original idea of getting the new game up and running, hahahaha… erm, sadly no. Progress is good, but not that good. However, I still am sending something. What I’m sending is the old PuffBOMB, from over 2 years ago, with a fresh paint job. The new look finally brings together my style ideas for the game from the past couple years It’s a chance to finally see it in action, and to know, does it suck or not.</description>

Some fun stuff this time. Wild Tangent’s Fate, more or less Diablo 2 with a pet. Geneforge 3, an oldskool non Japanese RPG. Facade, the crazy … simulation of … people … with marage problems. Yeah, some really great stuff this month.
As for what’s going on, I originally ruled out the idea of actually getting something done for the IGF, but I’m starting to think I can pull something together.</description>

      <description>Amazing. Today was my official last day at Big Blue Bubble. BBB was a great place to work, but I’m a too ambitious for my own good. So, lets see if I can make this happen.
The next couple weeks are some down time. Taking things easy, doing some organization, making backups, and so on. Being realistic, I’ve missed my chance to make the IGF. On the other hand, there’s still something this year I can shoot for.</description>

      <description>Wow, it’s that time again already. Don’t look so impressed.
This was a unique month. To start, we actually recieved 11 full versions! Wow. Usually, we get anywhere from 1-3 full versions per month. This time, we had a whopping 11 (1 being freeware).
As for the games… ha ha ha… I’m not telling you. Ok, several interesting ones. Mexican Motor Mafia was the unanimous favorite; Ultratron, Puppytron on crack; Magic Blackboard, the strangest Breakout/Arkanoid ever… with “Space Gator”, as Anthony Flack put it; And finally, Summer School Girls, which was a game designed for the sole purpose of freaking me out.</description>

Here’s “Ghastly logo“. For my own amusement, you can see it’s evolution below.</description>

Also, this is the 12th roundup, so guess what? The roundup’s are now a year old. Spiffy. I’ve only been involved for the past 8 months, but crazy ‘ol Mike Homel’s been going strong since the beginning. Congratz.

      <description>GameTunnel’s Monthly Roundup for April is up. Twas a good month, many cool games, and I didn’t make much of an ass of myself either. Bonus . The roundup’s have been a fun little research project of mine, gathering tactical and other information about what’s going on in the world of indie gaming. Impressive enough, I just broke the 100 review barrier. I’m now sitting at 101 reviews. Wow. That’s … many!</description>

      <description>Not much to say. I discovered an interesting feature I’m sure I knew, but always ignored in Paint Shop Pro. The wonderful world of layer masks. From an existing sketch we extract the line art as a mask, and can now do all kinds of fun coloring. We can fill in a whole layer with a color, apply the mask to only show color where the line art was, then color under on other layers to fill it in.</description>
