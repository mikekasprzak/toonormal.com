  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve started reading the ancient little book on writing. I eventually attacked the book with a highlighter, but I know I will forget some of my thought, so I&rsquo;ve decided to take notes.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have to say it, but if you&rsquo;re trying to gleen what&rsquo;s in the book by reading this, don&rsquo;t bother. Go buy the book. It&rsquo;s $10 brand new.</p>
<h3 id="1-form-the-posessive-singular-of-nouns-by-adding-s">1. Form the posessive singular of nouns by adding &rsquo;s</h3>
<p>Cool. Charles&rsquo;s friend. Don&rsquo;t do the &ldquo;Charles&rsquo; friend&rdquo; thing. I never liked it anyway.</p>
<p><code>his</code>, <code>hers</code>, <code>ours</code>, <code>its</code>, <code>theirs</code>, <code>yours</code>. Everywhere else use &rsquo;s. <code>it's</code> vs <code>its</code> perfectly demonstrates this, to remove the ambiguity of <code>its</code> vs the <code>it is</code> contraction. I think I&rsquo;ve been doing this anyway, but I like seeing this spelled out.</p>
<h3 id="2-in-a-series-of-three-or-more-terms-with-a-single-conjunction-use-a-single-comma-after-each-term-except-the-last">2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a single comma after each term except the last</h3>
<p>The wording here is slightly deceptive. Unless you&rsquo;re paying close attention, it might read like a &ldquo;no Oxford comma&rdquo;, but in fact it&rsquo;s for the comma, also known as the Serial Comma.</p>
<p>The only exception called out here is basically law firms. Johnson, David &amp; Johnson.</p>
<h3 id="3-enclose-parenthetic-expressions-between-commas">3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas</h3>
<p>Okay! I think it&rsquo;s an omission that the book doesn&rsquo;t define parenthetic in the glossary. Parenthetic is a writing concept, and we haven&rsquo;t even got to the (parenthesis) usage.</p>
<p>I ended up marking up the two lines they use as bad examples with red X&rsquo;s, just so I could more quickly skim and know they were intentionally wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 2 concepts here that aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive: parenthetic expressions and restrictive vs non-restrictive clauses. The glossary does an okay version of defining what a restrictive clause is, but how it differs from the non-restrictive clause needs comma parenthetic expressions to be a thing to work.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>The two examples provided by the <code>restrictive term</code> glossary entry the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional athletes who perform exceptionally should earn stratospheric salaries.</li>
<li>Professional athletes, who perform exceptionally, should earn stratospheric salaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s suggested the 2nd version applies to all athletes, where as the 1st is only to those who &ldquo;perform exceptionally&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m no literary major, but I don&rsquo;t buy this. EXCEPT if you understand that by the previous definition of parenthetic expressions, the 2nd line should be read as follows since it contains commas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional athletes (who perform exceptionally) should earn statospheric salaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meaning that the words is parethesis are optional and non-binding. Even though it can be interpreted as restrictive, it should be considered non-restrictive due to the commas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I like this, but I do think it&rsquo;s good to have a clear distinction between statements of a finite nature, athletes that match criteria, vs those that are meant for anyone. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this sounds like rambling, but I had to take concept too far for me to remember it.</p>
<p>Are all statements with 2+ commas now parenthetic?</p>
<p>That is what it seems to suggest, but I&rsquo;ll have to read more to be sure. Like yes, I can do this, but it&rsquo;s a weird style change for me. Many sentences in this noisy ramble are potenital victims of being misclassified as parenthetic.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<h3 id="4-place-a-comma-before-a-conjunction-introducing-an-independent-clause">4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m right! Conjunction is in the glossary, but not parenthetic?</p>
<p>The above demonstrates comma being used in this way.</p>
<p>The final part dives in to where a conjunction comma should be used, but if it&rsquo;s an <code>and</code>, and the subject matter is directly related, the comma can be omitted. But like the previous sentence demonstrated, once you start comma&rsquo;ing, you best be consistent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning, right?</p>
