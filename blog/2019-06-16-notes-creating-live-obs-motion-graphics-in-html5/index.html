<p>Our ability to make live motion graphics that move and even use live data is made possible thanks to the OBS Browser plugin. The plugin ships with the Windows/Mac version of OBS, but the original repo is an important reference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows, Mac: <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-browser">https://github.com/obsproject/obs-browser</a></li>
<li>Linux: <a href="https://github.com/bazukas/obs-linuxbrowser">https://github.com/bazukas/obs-linuxbrowser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have not done much testing with Linux yet, but in quick tests it was working. See the FAQ for some notes on some funny stuff (there&rsquo;s an alpha glitch, but it sounds like it&rsquo;s fixable according to some comments).</p>
<h1 id="running-a-webserver">Running a webserver</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, the best way to take advantage of the browser plugin is to run a webserver. There are <strong>A LOT</strong> of options here for what you can do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Linux guy that uses Windows out of necessity (this blog post is being written on Linux however). For me, a Windows install is incomplete without WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). With it, you can install the lastest stable version of Ubuntu using Microsoft&rsquo;s Linux Kernel (yes, you didn&rsquo;t read that wrong). I wont detail how to do that here (one command in an administrator powershell, then use Microsoft store to get Ubuntu 18.04).</p>
<p>With WSL available, you can install helpful packages. I like PHP, and PHP has some nice features we can utilize, such as a built-in webserver:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">php -S localhost:8080
</code></pre></div><p>This starts a webserver using the local directory as the document root. More details on PHP&rsquo;s builtin webserver: <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php">https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php</a></p>
<p>This is a single threaded server, impractical for live use, but more than adequate for something locally hosted used exclusively by OBS. You also have the option to run PHP code, including reading/writing from local files, or interfacing with a database (though setup is more work).</p>
<h1 id="windowobsstudio">window.obsstudio</h1>
<p>The OBS Browser source plugin adds <code>obsstudio</code> to the <code>window</code> namespace, and fills it with functions, data, and events you can tap in to to learn about things happening outside the browser inside OBS.</p>
<p>Obviously this will be unavailable when testing your pages in the browser. For simple motion graphics it might not be a big deal, but for more advanced work you do have another option.</p>
<h1 id="debugging-with-chrome-dev-tools">Debugging with Chrome Dev Tools</h1>
<p>Insert details here. Long story short, you start OBS with a certain argument to specify what port it&rsquo;ll listen on, then use Chrome Dev Tools&rsquo; remote feature to connect. You&rsquo;ll even get those sweet blue popups.</p>
<h1 id="obs-events">OBS Events</h1>
<p>By default, OBS loads all browser during startup. This means if you have any timing or fetch requests going on, they will kick-off all at once during application start. This is unlikely an issue, but it&rsquo;s something to think about.</p>
<p>When it comes to animated scenes (tickers, info bars, etc), you can&rsquo;t rely on animations to stay perfectly in sync. However, with a bit of planning, you can at least guarentee that each page is pre-loaded.</p>
<p>The OBS Browser plugin</p>
<h1 id="animated-content">Animated content</h1>
<p>Generally speaking, anything you can do in a browser is allowed.</p>
<p>OH HEY, THIS POST IS UNFINISHED. OH WHAT WAS MIKE THINKING WHEN HE WROTE THIS? ;)</p>
