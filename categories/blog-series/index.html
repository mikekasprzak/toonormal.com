  <div class="post-content"><p>Here‚Äôs a couple videos from <a href="http://youtube.com/user/indieconversation">the series</a>, some of the more odd things I‚Äôve posted.</p>
<p>The first is a response to a topic of inspiration posed by Andy Moore. I try to get out for walks as often as I can, and I bring with me a camera phone‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs what I see:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next was something from this past weekend. I picked up an iCade, which is an arcade controller for an iPad, and I got it working with something NOT an iPad.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It‚Äôs a neat device. You can get more details about coding for it <a href="http://struct.ca/2011/icademanager/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This catches up my queue. I have some videos about some of my thought process on the new game, but I‚Äôll bring those up at a later time once I have more to say.</p>

    <p>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures....</p>

    <h2>Introducing: The Indie Indie Conversation</h2>

  <div class="entry-meta">

  </div>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I‚Äôve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I‚Äôve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of Smiles, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.
To start, I‚Äôm going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year....</p>
