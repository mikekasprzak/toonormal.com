      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a couple videos from the series, some of the more odd things I&amp;rsquo;ve posted.
The first is a response to a topic of inspiration posed by Andy Moore. I try to get out for walks as often as I can, and I bring with me a camera phone&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s what I see:
  Next was something from this past weekend. I picked up an iCade, which is an arcade controller for an iPad, and I got it working with something NOT an iPad.</description>

      <description>The latest in the world of Mike, I might win something again.
  I&amp;rsquo;m less than an hour away from finding out if it&amp;rsquo;s true, so here&amp;rsquo;s me killing minutes as I wait.</description>

      <title>Conversation: Business and Fear</title>

      <description>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
  I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures.</description>

      <title>Introducing: The Indie Indie Conversation</title>

      <description>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I&amp;rsquo;ve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù.</description>

      <description>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of Smiles, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.
To start, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year.</description>
