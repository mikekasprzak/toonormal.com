    <p>Not bad for a game originally created for a 48 hour competition. The 2006 PopCap Casual Game Award Finalists:  Cloud – Cloud Joboo’s Gems – Gem Jocks Ocular Ink – Pistachio Productions The Odyssey – Liquid Dragon Studios PuffBOMB – Sykhronics Entertainment  Press release can be found here.
In the unlikely circumstance that someone who’s actually attending reads my blog, I’d greatly appreciate any photos of the game at the event....</p>

    <p>I’ve brought with me this horribly bright colored monster to burn your cornea. Hurah!
Right. Things are back and working in the Mike camp. Back to the grind and all. I’ve also recently finished a drawing pad, after slightly over 3 months. Doesn’t sound like much, but looking back it’s been taking me up to a year to fill one up.
So IGF finalists have been announced. Funky. So many great games have been coming out later in the year, I’m not surprised PuffBOMB didn’t place....</p>

    <h2>IGF and PuffBOMB clones?</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Well, well. The IGF 2006 Entries are now online, and we have a PuffBOMB clone to duel with. Impulse. It appers to be, according to the description, pretty much the same idea. Lets quote.
 Impulse: The player must place bombs and adjust their timers to make a ball hit the goal field. Obstacles, special elements and force fields provide varied levels. An interactive timeline helps controlling the game by jumping to specific times and guarantees a flexible and unique gameplay....</p>

    <p>Apparently I forgot about this. The Slamdance Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition is yet another IGF like compo. I don’t think it’s actually worth any prizes… at least none their publicizing. Either way, I’ve put together a publicity pack for them, and will be sending it off today. A shame that they’re making me pay to enter. Buh.
I think what turned me off about this “way back when” was that the game had to be profitless, but apparently that’s not the case anymore....</p>

    <p>Oh wow, the IGF is getting serious now. A news report on Gamasutra suggested that the IGF hit a record entry high of 117… Which is… many.
Like the dork I am, I’ll be monitoring this stuff. Don’t think this’ll be the last of my IGF rantings, oh no! Mwahaha!
Oh, and I’ve aparently become a big fan of incorrectly linking the IGF. Instead, I’ve found myself linking an equally prestigious organization, The Royal Society for the Relief of Indigent Gentlewomen of Scotland (Fund)....</p>

    <p>Hmm, it seems I misplaced this blog post.
With less than 5 hours to spare, it’s in. Excellent. It wasn’t without it’s drama though. Once confirmed by myself, my brother, and a few friends that everything was good, I began to upload. *OH GOOD*, the upload server was acting up! Ack!
Within 20 minutes things cleared up. I snuck my game into it’s folder, hit the switch, and waited as it’s bytes were sucked out of Canada into some server likely in the California area....</p>

    <p>Clock is ticking.
Yep. In one sense, I’m ready to go. I filled out the submission for yesterday, and paid my entry fee. Apparently however, you need an installer. *Oh*. So today, after finishing the missing graphics, I got to do that. Huge thanks to Seth for sharing with me his NSIS script, which saved me hours of digging for little things like uninstaller cleanlyness, icon changing, and so many silly little things....</p>

    <p>A bit of a last minute scramble to get something together for the IGF. My original idea of getting the new game up and running, hahahaha… erm, sadly no. Progress is good, but not that good. However, I still am sending something. What I’m sending is the old PuffBOMB, from over 2 years ago, with a fresh paint job. The new look finally brings together my style ideas for the game from the past couple years It’s a chance to finally see it in action, and to know, does it suck or not....</p>
