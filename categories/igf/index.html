  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So, holy cow! GDC was absolutely insane! I almost don‚Äôt know where to start, but lets start from the beginning.
First thing first, I won again!!
Yes, as if winning a free car wasn‚Äôt enough, I also won a free trip to GDC. So Intel ended up covering my flight, putting me up in a fancy hotel, gave me some spending money, treating me to dinner, AND giving me nearly front row seats to a San Jose Sharks hockey game!...</p>

    <p>I know it‚Äôs hard to compete with the wake of the IGF Finalists announcement yesterday, but the Ludum Dare 16 winners were announced yesterday too.
Go here for the Top 20:

Trying to compete with the IGF Buzz would be silly, so I‚Äôm going to push back my little LD retrospective until things are a little more calm....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So wow. That‚Äôs finally it for 2009. Like doing taxes ever year, I feel a special sort of obligation that I write some sort of retrospective, especially after such an eventful year as this one. Far more awesome than taxes. üòâ
I wasn‚Äôt sure where to start, so I ended up categorizing aspects of the year. I‚Äôll free form rant about each topic as I come to it.
Let‚Äôs begin....</p>

    <h2>The shelf-life of Smiles</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Smiles has been available for nearly 6 months in the App Store now. From the stories you may have heard, not all iPhone titles necessarily do well. But if you consider that the game was developed by one person in 4 months, it lives under the charts, and has only 1 Apple mention to it‚Äôs name, it‚Äôs actually done alright. I‚Äôm hardly ‚Äúrolling in the dough‚Äù, but I can make ends meet....</p>

    <h2>Smiles Statistics at GDC</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>For GDC, I decided to make a special version of Smiles. On the surface it would look like the Lite version (Free Smiles), except I re-enabled statistic tracking and high scores.
Here is how the visitors at my IGF kiosk did.
General Statistics
Total Time Played: 7 hours, 39 minutes
Games Played: 131
Zen Statistics
Total Time Playing: 4 hour, 12 minutes
Games Played: 78
Games Won: 33
Total Moves: 2640...</p>

    <h2>The GDC and IGF Retrospective</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Just a few hours ago I could barely move. Nearly crawling my way out of bed to attack the day (ahem‚Ä¶ night), after the long flight home.
I‚Äôve since returned to my regular routine of pacing around my studio (i.e. basement), between moments of awe e-mailing and ranting everywhere it seems appropriate (forums, twitter). As I exhausted all those wonderful forms of communication, it seemed to be right time to start the required retrospective post....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Friday was the short day. Wednesday and Thursday we exhibited 10-6, where Friday was 10-3. Went back to the hotel and vegged that day, before heading back out to hang with the Fantastic Contraption guys.
My neighbors were the Secret Exit guys. I ended up spending a bulk of the show goofing off with Tuukka, an artist on Zen Bound. The Secret Exit guys refer to him as the ‚Äúprankster‚Äù of the bunch....</p>

    <h2>Smiles at the IGF Mobile &amp;#8211; Wednesday</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>First day of exhibiting. I have to say, I‚Äôm exhausted. Feet ached, and limped a bit throughout the day, but I loved it.
Here‚Äôs a few photos of the completed setup.

And a little closer.

I‚Äôm sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale....</p>

    <p>Live from San Fransisco, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ me.
As you may or may not have heard, I didn‚Äôt win. But that‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôm still here to exhibit.
We‚Äôre sharing booth space with the IGF main competition entrants, which is great. That way, when people come to see the cool IGF games, they‚Äôll find us too. Here‚Äôs my slice.

Other cool stuff, Apple put up a page of us IGF Mobile entries. Very awesome....</p>
