      <description>So, holy cow! GDC was absolutely insane! I almost don‚Äôt know where to start, but lets start from the beginning.
First thing first, I won again!!
Yes, as if winning a free car wasn‚Äôt enough, I also won a free trip to GDC. So Intel ended up covering my flight, putting me up in a fancy hotel, gave me some spending money, treating me to dinner, AND giving me nearly front row seats to a San Jose Sharks hockey game!</description>

      <description>I know it‚Äôs hard to compete with the wake of the IGF Finalists announcement yesterday, but the Ludum Dare 16 winners were announced yesterday too.
Go here for the Top 20:

Trying to compete with the IGF Buzz would be silly, so I‚Äôm going to push back my little LD retrospective until things are a little more calm.</description>

      <description>So wow. That‚Äôs finally it for 2009. Like doing taxes ever year, I feel a special sort of obligation that I write some sort of retrospective, especially after such an eventful year as this one. Far more awesome than taxes. üòâ
I wasn‚Äôt sure where to start, so I ended up categorizing aspects of the year. I‚Äôll free form rant about each topic as I come to it.
Let‚Äôs begin.</description>

      <description>Smiles has been available for nearly 6 months in the App Store now. From the stories you may have heard, not all iPhone titles necessarily do well. But if you consider that the game was developed by one person in 4 months, it lives under the charts, and has only 1 Apple mention to it‚Äôs name, it‚Äôs actually done alright. I‚Äôm hardly ‚Äúrolling in the dough‚Äù, but I can make ends meet.</description>

      <description>For GDC, I decided to make a special version of Smiles. On the surface it would look like the Lite version (Free Smiles), except I re-enabled statistic tracking and high scores.
Here is how the visitors at my IGF kiosk did.
General Statistics
Total Time Played: 7 hours, 39 minutes
Games Played: 131
Zen Statistics
Total Time Playing: 4 hour, 12 minutes

      <description>Just a few hours ago I could barely move. Nearly crawling my way out of bed to attack the day (ahem‚Ä¶ night), after the long flight home.
I‚Äôve since returned to my regular routine of pacing around my studio (i.e. basement), between moments of awe e-mailing and ranting everywhere it seems appropriate (forums, twitter). As I exhausted all those wonderful forms of communication, it seemed to be right time to start the required retrospective post.</description>

      <description>Friday was the short day. Wednesday and Thursday we exhibited 10-6, where Friday was 10-3. Went back to the hotel and vegged that day, before heading back out to hang with the Fantastic Contraption guys.
My neighbors were the Secret Exit guys. I ended up spending a bulk of the show goofing off with Tuukka, an artist on Zen Bound. The Secret Exit guys refer to him as the ‚Äúprankster‚Äù of the bunch.</description>

      <description>First day of exhibiting. I have to say, I‚Äôm exhausted. Feet ached, and limped a bit throughout the day, but I loved it.
Here‚Äôs a few photos of the completed setup.

And a little closer.

I‚Äôm sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale.</description>

      <description>Live from San Fransisco, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ me.
As you may or may not have heard, I didn‚Äôt win. But that‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôm still here to exhibit.
We‚Äôre sharing booth space with the IGF main competition entrants, which is great. That way, when people come to see the cool IGF games, they‚Äôll find us too. Here‚Äôs my slice.

Other cool stuff, Apple put up a page of us IGF Mobile entries. Very awesome.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm back. This time, I‚Äôm ready for GDC!
Come take an early look at the madness I‚Äôm bringing with me to the conference.
As you can probably guess from the lack of Smiles PC/HD progress posts, I will not be demoing it at the conference. I am still bringing both laptops though. The big one will be doing something else instead.
Enjoy! üôÇ</description>

      <description>Yet another series, but video.
Part 1 of hopefully a few videos of me showing off my IGF preparations. Sinage, computers, etc.
3 weeks left and counting.
A bit roughly put together, but that‚Äôs half the point. I didn‚Äôt want it to eat up that much time, though it did take me some time to remember how to edit and encode a video (without my software crashing).
It‚Äôs no Goo Road to the IGF, but hey.</description>

      <description>Alright, so the clock says it‚Äôs Friday now. According to my whiteboard, that‚Äôs 29 days before I leave for the Game Developers Conference. Between now and then, I have a few commitments to take care of. Possibly a 2nd draft for my writing engagement, jury (selection?) duty, in addition to IGF preparations. It‚Äôs also an important turning point for Smiles as a product and a brand.¬†Lets talk about that.</description>

      <description>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of Smiles, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.
To start, I‚Äôm going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year.</description>

      <description>Wow, and yikes. Time flies. IGF Submission time again. October 1st ‚Äòeh? I should probably enter. shrug
Here‚Äôs something interesting.
 The 2008 IGF Main Competition will again be open to all independent developers to submit their games ‚Äì whether it be on PC, console digital download, Web browser, or other more exotic formats.
 Cool, but doesn‚Äôt that have to mean your game is already available/to be available by October?</description>

      <description>I think I‚Äôve already posted about this everywhere, except here. If you‚Äôre like me, and decided to skip out on Travel, Hotel, and admission to GDC, you can get the meat of the event for a fair $32.
GDC Radio Store
$8 gets you a day (about 6 hours of talks) for either the Indie Games Summit or the Casual Games Summit. Nice. Buy ‚Äòem all for nearly 24 hours of interesting discussions and talks.</description>

      <description>I like Slamdance. I entered PuffBOMB last year, and was a finalist for the casual game award. Since then, I‚Äôve been excited that a more ‚Äúartful‚Äù game competition was beginning to take off. Winners receive a funky ugly dog statuette. Cool! Then a controversial game was pulled. Things are not going well now.
It‚Äôs a real shame, and I hope something good comes from the controversy, rather than developing in to more Jack Thompson style heat for our industry.</description>

      <description>It seems I missed the memo.
The 2nd Independent Games compilation was released back in September (25th), and that PuffBOMB game I seem to talk about all the time was included.
As well, there was a set of concept art included in the package. Said art can also be seen right here.
I suppose I should go find a way to acquire a copy, ‚Äôcause I‚Äôm not sure what happened to a complimentary one.</description>

      <description>Thursday, another big day at the Game Developers Conference.
Yesterday had some good events. The IGF results were announced, and the evil forces of Darwinia ran away with most of the prize money. Curse you Darwinia, I will have my revenge! Sony also spilled the beans, announcing a service ‚Äúlike‚Äù Xbox Live Arcade, but neglects to invite Indie‚Äôs. How rude. And everyone‚Äôs talking about Duke Nukem Forever 2.
It‚Äôll be tough to beat a day as grand as yesterday, but today is always looking for a challenge.</description>

      <description>Slamdance was last week. PuffBOMB was a finalist for the PopCap award. A game by the name of Odyssey took the award. Congratz to them. The rest of the results can be found here.
It‚Äôs a shame, but I couldn‚Äôt make it out this year. That, and I‚Äôm still getting things off the ground here at Syko. I had heard from my ‚Äúcontact‚Äù there would be some PuffBOMB action at the festival, but so far my search for evidence has come up short.</description>

Right. Things are back and working in the Mike camp. Back to the grind and all. I‚Äôve also recently finished a drawing pad, after slightly over 3 months. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but looking back it‚Äôs been taking me up to a year to fill one up.
So IGF finalists have been announced. Funky. So many great games have been coming out later in the year, I‚Äôm not surprised PuffBOMB didn‚Äôt place.</description>

      <description>Well, well. The IGF 2006 Entries are now online, and we have a PuffBOMB clone to duel with. Impulse. It appers to be, according to the description, pretty much the same idea. Lets quote.
 Impulse: The player must place bombs and adjust their timers to make a ball hit the goal field. Obstacles, special elements and force fields provide varied levels. An interactive timeline helps controlling the game by jumping to specific times and guarantees a flexible and unique gameplay.</description>

      <description>Apparently I forgot about this. The Slamdance Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition is yet another IGF like compo. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs actually worth any prizes‚Ä¶ at least none their publicizing. Either way, I‚Äôve put together a publicity pack for them, and will be sending it off today. A shame that they‚Äôre making me pay to enter. Buh.
I think what turned me off about this ‚Äúway back when‚Äù was that the game had to be profitless, but apparently that‚Äôs not the case anymore.</description>

      <description>Oh wow, the IGF is getting serious now. A news report on Gamasutra suggested that the IGF hit a record entry high of 117‚Ä¶ Which is‚Ä¶ many.
Like the dork I am, I‚Äôll be monitoring this stuff. Don‚Äôt think this‚Äôll be the last of my IGF rantings, oh no! Mwahaha!
Oh, and I‚Äôve aparently become a big fan of incorrectly linking the IGF. Instead, I‚Äôve found myself linking an equally prestigious organization, The Royal Society for the Relief of Indigent Gentlewomen of Scotland (Fund).</description>

With less than 5 hours to spare, it‚Äôs in. Excellent. It wasn‚Äôt without it‚Äôs drama though. Once confirmed by myself, my brother, and a few friends that everything was good, I began to upload. *OH GOOD*, the upload server was acting up! Ack!
Within 20 minutes things cleared up. I snuck my game into it‚Äôs folder, hit the switch, and waited as it‚Äôs bytes were sucked out of Canada into some server likely in the California area.</description>

      <description>Clock is ticking.
Yep. In one sense, I‚Äôm ready to go. I filled out the submission for yesterday, and paid my entry fee. Apparently however, you need an installer. *Oh*. So today, after finishing the missing graphics, I got to do that. Huge thanks to Seth for sharing with me his NSIS script, which saved me hours of digging for little things like uninstaller cleanlyness, icon changing, and so many silly little things.</description>

      <description>A bit of a last minute scramble to get something together for the IGF. My original idea of getting the new game up and running, hahahaha‚Ä¶ erm, sadly no. Progress is good, but not that good. However, I still am sending something. What I‚Äôm sending is the old PuffBOMB, from over 2 years ago, with a fresh paint job. The new look finally brings together my style ideas for the game from the past couple years It‚Äôs a chance to finally see it in action, and to know, does it suck or not.</description>
