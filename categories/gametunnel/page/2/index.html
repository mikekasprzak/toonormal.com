    <h2>September Tunnel Syndrome</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The September Tunneling is up, and extra shiny. It was a light month, so we had to go back, and pick up a few from earlier in the year. Kisses, Zombie Smashers and Heavy Weapon being your older games. Personal favorites for this month would include The Strategist, Virus and The Goat in the Grey Fedora.
Doing the reviews like we do (blind, we don’t see each others scores until we’re all done), I always seem to have a game or two scoring regret....</p>

    <h2>Tunnel for August</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The round up is here. Hurah.
An underwater sequel to Cosmo Bots, a mech 3D shooter War World, Diablo meets Gauntlet in Evil Invasion, and a double dose of cavemen. An alright month. We’ve had better.
But wait! What is this? Bright red, black, orange and blue banners? Oh noes! What could this be? An add campaign for some wacky game? Inconceivable!...</p>

  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>July roundup action. Check it out here.
Some fun stuff this time. Wild Tangent’s Fate, more or less Diablo 2 with a pet. Geneforge 3, an oldskool non Japanese RPG. Facade, the crazy … simulation of … people … with marage problems. Yeah, some really great stuff this month.
As for what’s going on, I originally ruled out the idea of actually getting something done for the IGF, but I’m starting to think I can pull something together....</p>

    <h2>Tunnel for June</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Wow, it’s that time again already. Don’t look so impressed.
This was a unique month. To start, we actually recieved 11 full versions! Wow. Usually, we get anywhere from 1-3 full versions per month. This time, we had a whopping 11 (1 being freeware).
As for the games… ha ha ha… I’m not telling you. Ok, several interesting ones. Mexican Motor Mafia was the unanimous favorite; Ultratron, Puppytron on crack; Magic Blackboard, the strangest Breakout/Arkanoid ever… with “Space Gator”, as Anthony Flack put it; And finally, Summer School Girls, which was a game designed for the sole purpose of freaking me out....</p>

    <h2>Tunnel for May, Rant&#43;1</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>GameTunnel’s Monthly Roundup for May is up. This was apparently a tough month to find enough games. Alas, we eventually made our quota of 14. Also, this is the 12th roundup, so guess what? The roundup’s are now a year old. Spiffy. I’ve only been involved for the past 8 months, but crazy ‘ol Mike Homel’s been going strong since the beginning. Congratz.
Too Normal has been quiet this past month, but hey, I haven’t announced this site just yet....</p>

    <h2>Tunnel for April</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>GameTunnel’s Monthly Roundup for April is up. Twas a good month, many cool games, and I didn’t make much of an ass of myself either. Bonus . The roundup’s have been a fun little research project of mine, gathering tactical and other information about what’s going on in the world of indie gaming. Impressive enough, I just broke the 100 review barrier. I’m now sitting at 101 reviews. Wow. That’s … many!...</p>
