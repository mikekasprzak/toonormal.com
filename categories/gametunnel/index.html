    <h1 class="post-title">Snakey Jake</h1>
    <div class="post-meta">Mike K · April 10, 2007
    </div>
  </header>
  <div class="post-content"><p>An interesting concept for design people. I’m calling them <strong>clicking platformers</strong>. Everybody’s played Wik, so I wont talk about Wik. This is a game I came across today called Snakey Jake.</p>
<p><a href="http://charliedoggames.com/">Snakey Jake</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fejyh1HP4cY">YouTube Video</a>)</p>
<p>It’s your usual casual game fare as far as graphics and polish are concerned. What I was expecting was a “click on a spot” sort of game and he’ll move to that spot, but it’s actually click on the platform and he’ll move to the nearest place on the platform. Either by slithering or jumping, where appropriate. It’s a good example of an intelligently simplified control scheme, as I expect several designers will be toying with more in the years to come.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t like this variation of control. True, it’s harder to make mistakes since you can’t click anywhere, but it annoys me as a player. Mostly because I’m a core gamer, and I’d imagine you could do some really interesting things with this gameplay style without the platform restriction. It also imposes a restriction of “you can only click on platforms that you can safely jump to from this platform”. Good for casual gamers, but not so much for me when I’m in the mood for a suicide jump. I’m also totally missing the opportunity for a conversation with myself about how I could or should have sooooo made that jump. Boo.</p>
<p>If I was still doing the roundup, I’d be bouncing back and forth between 6 and 8. Higher because of design merit, ’cause I think it’s a notable game as far as game design for casual gamers, and the only other game I can think of to compare it to is Wik. Lower because I personally didn’t like the decision to go with platform clicking, as a personal gamer preference. I’d muddle over that for a day if I wasn’t behind schedule, or an hour if I was the one holding us back.</p>

    <h2>May Round-Up, and my last</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The round up for may is up. Heh, I’m sure I’m going to be scolded by Mike and Seth for not finding time to mention to them that this would be my last round up, but in a way, that’s half the reason why. Busy busy.
A hand full of interesting games this month. Eets, the TIM like game with the hungry mood swing guy; Bone: The Great Cow Race, a fine modern example of comic gone adventure game; Odyssey: Winds of Athena, the game with the water currents gameplay; and American History Lux, desensitizing gamers of war since 1754....</p>

    <h2>April Round Up-Up</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yup, I’m a few days behind mentioning this, but this month’s round up is up. A personal favorite of mine, Titan Attacks reigned supreme, followed by the slick steam powered airship game, Steam Brigade, and the un-noted but equally as surprisingly quality Inlay clone, Mosaic: Tomb of Mystery. Fun stuff.
As expected, I’m going to say things are going well with the game, despite the updates. Actually, better than well. Much Biz oriented stuff, which I’m going to have to sit on for a while....</p>

    <h2>8 ways to annoy the panel</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Now that I’ve succeeded in world domination (also known as syndication), I present to you a short list of complaints to fellow developers. 8 ways to make the monthly round-up panel hate you. Unofficial in every way, as it’s just my observations, but toned a tad sarcastic and sharp to get the point across. It’s not for everyone, as we do get a good number of games that work great. But there’s just enough of them to compel me to write this....</p>

    <h2>Marching Round, and Up</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yep, it’s that time of month. Tell me, what’s round, monthly and up? I shouldn’t have to answer that question.
A pretty light month. A slick little Final Fantasy’esc RPG, Aveyond. An adventure game with this big blue thing and a really long name, Frasse and the Peas of Kekick. Yes, that’s right. An undersea adventure, Joust revisited, a card game, and more at the Tunnel.
Yeah, I’ve been quieter than I had hoped....</p>

    <h2>Round and Up February</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Dude! There’s like, this site. And it has something to do with tunnels, or tunneling. Boy, I could tell you stories of tunneling. But they’re so amazing, they’d blow the minds of my 5 readers. The problem is I’d then have to acquire a new reader base. I can’t have that. Especially with the likes of Jack Black and Bob Villa reading. Their fans would kill me.
Right, so the more temporally correct but logically wrong February Round Up is online....</p>

    <h2>December&amp;#8217;s Round Up of the Odd</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yes, your monthly dose of round uppage is online.
After having many great games these past few round up’s, it was expected things would cool down. This month has some cool stuff, but nothing that’s going to pull a Weird Words or such on you. The Mastermind being my favorite of the month, despite it being depressingly buggy. This followed by the funky physics motorcycle game Motorama, some addiction to Egypt with Egyptian Addiction, and a healthy dose of shooting and space games, and some Arkanoids for good measure....</p>

    <h2>2005 Games in Review</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Inspired by a discussion on Indie Gamer, and Game Tunnel’s end of year awards. Apparently it wasn’t clear, but us round up’ers were not involved in the end of year awards. So, to make up for it, I’m going to pick my favorites from the last year (December to November’s round up). I’m not going to rate them, just list them. Here we go.

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The roundup for November is up, just in time for the big day December 25th. 10 again this time.
Many good games this month. Land of Legends, the fantasy strategy game in the top spot, followed by the wildlife park simulator Venture Africa, a hardcore space trading sim Flatspace II, an aquarium store simulator Fish Tycoon, and a slick little soccer player simulator New Star Soccer 3. Good stuff....</p>

    <h2>October Tunnels, MD</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The round up for October is up, sporting the sexah new look for the Game Tunnel website. This month sees Russell joining the ranks of the illustrious panel, bringing us to 4. It also shows us taking a more reserved 10 game count, which I think we’ll be sticking with moving forward.
So, how was the month? Two games I really liked this month, Weird Worlds and Cute Knight. Just as I said in my review, and as the others agreed, Weird Worlds is great....</p>
