      <description>So this will be an ongoing project.
I used to have some old PCs sitting in my closet. They take up a lot of space, and they&amp;rsquo;re heavy. So on a whim (as it always is), I decided to gut the PCs.
One of them, apparently I had already removed the power supply, so it was gone (if I remember, it was quite noisy, so no loss). The other still had its PSU, so I&amp;rsquo;ve selected it as the donor to my bench-top power supply project.</description>
