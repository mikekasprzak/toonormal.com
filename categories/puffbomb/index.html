    <h1 class="post-title">Introducing: The Indie Indie Conversation</h1>
    <div class="post-meta">Mike K · July 19, 2011
    </div>
  </header>
  <div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://youtube.com/user/indieconversation"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I’ve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the <a href="http://youtube.com/user/indieconversation">Indie Indie Conversation</a>. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.</p>
<p>I’ve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of “talking to a wall”. All these attempts seem to lack the personal charm (not to say I’m charming) and comfortable honesty I think they needed to really work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hamumu.com">Mike Hommel</a>, a friend, fellow indie developer, and fellow former co-writer with me on GameTunnel’s Monthly Round-up pitched the idea: Why don’t we try talking to each-other? Hence the conversation was born.</p>
<p>I didn’t announce this right away, as I wasn’t sure we were going to keep it up. Plus, I wanted to be sure and finally comfortable with my … ahem… “performance” in the video. I’m no public speaker, but recently I’ve been doing some of my best improvised recorded video work, and I’d like to start sharing them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Above is a video where I talk about regrets of the past 6 years, being a full time indie. I think it does a great job capturing what we aim for in the series, and perhaps what’s special about it (honesty, trials, tribulations).</p>
<p>We create <strong>A LOT</strong> of content though, as the point is it <strong>HAS TO BE</strong> quick for us to make. As of this writing, we’re nearly at 150 videos, and 12 hours of content. Seeing how this is my blog, I’ll be picking, choosing, and sharing some of my best videos with you here, as I do think they are topical to my <em>reader</em> (hi mom).</p>
<p>If you’re an indie game developer that’s in the mood to burn away a day (or two), I recommend you dive in to the archives. Videos are added to the channel chronologically, and YouTube lets you sort in reverse order by clicking the field names, so make good use of that! Check us out:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/indieconversation#p/u">http://www.youtube.com/user/indieconversation#p/u</a></p>
<p>I’ll be back with a few more posts of these, and content specific to me and my own games soon.</p>

    <h2>PuffBOMB Featured on GameJolt</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I’m actually in the middle of a rather large post, but I still felt this was worth noting (while inappropriate for the other post). PuffBOMB, my explosive little freeware game is currently featured on GameJolt.

GameJolt is a unique games website that’s a bit like a “Kongregate” for freeware. I put PuffBOMB up there some time last week to try it out, and it’s pretty cool.
The site has a neat feature for downloading and playing PC games right from the browser....</p>

    <h2>Release Candidate 1</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>It’s late, now 5 AM Saturday morning. Release Candidate 1 is just a few hours away. Some achievement tweaks, and minor bugs and we’re good.
Should go out to Apple on Monday afternoon. Then probably a week and it’ll be live in the App Store.
I’d have taken a photo, but I’m currently cameraless.

The dummy website for the game:

Some time after it goes out, I’ll make a proper site....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Ballistic Force wasn’t a long project, but development was dense.
Early on, I attempted a poorly conceived idea of creating densely constructed particle landscape. I wanted a system sort of like molecular/planetary attraction to keep scenery together, and allow clumping like a cartoon snowball rolling down a hill. It might have worked on something highly parallel like a GPU or the PS3’s SPE’s, but my design really wasn’t well thought out....</p>

    <p>This next engines name and story is a little complicated.
Game development became a constant burn out for me. Since finishing Secret Agent Barbie (Gameboy Advance) and Polly Pocket (Gameboy Advance), it became clear to me the only thing keeping me going was my fascination with new platforms. Certainly not the subject matter.
After we finished Polly Pocket, I asked for a month off to deal with my burn out. However, we quickly picked up a new game, Barbie: Gotta Have Games (Playstation)....</p>

    <h2>Engines, Names and Evolution &amp;#8211; Part 1</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Over the years, I’ve given names to game engines I’ve worked on. Most of my professional experience has been working on platformers and mini-game collections. Mini-games rarely share much in common, so by engines I’m referring to platformers, or engines for games very much like platformers.
I’d like to start talking about what I’ve been thinking about whilst designing my next engine. I need to set some context though, so I’ll be walking through some of more significant engines I’ve worked on....</p>

    <h2>Retrospective?</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yeah, sorry. I wanted to do detailed commentary of The Spider stuffs, the in between stuff, and get in to the new PuffBOMB stuff, but it looks like it didn’t happen. I wrote an outline and drafted a couple parts, but I wasn’t happy with the results.
“New PuffBOMB” has been down to just me since October. The artist finished his work, which turned out great. Richard got a job, and has been unavailable to help since....</p>

    <h2>The &amp;#8220;New&amp;#8221; Project, Part 1</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Before starting work on “The Spider”, I was building the engine for the “new PuffBOMB”. The concept behind the engine, 2D characters and physics, 3D backgrounds styled to look 2D, HD ready. Pretty standard stuff.
The concept behind “The Spider” is, unlike a normal platformer where you stand on the ground, this one you wouldn’t. Instead you would hang from and move along ceilings. The best idea I had at the time for pulling it off was something I nicknamed “double ropes”, one to support, and one for action....</p>

    <p>Pestering works. So it’s September now. Last time I gave a *real* update was a year and a half ago. A 7&#43;1 part blog series titled “And the Project”, where I introduced what went in to a concept I called “The Spider”. You can read it here:
Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4
Part 5, Part 6, Part 7, Part “&#43;1″
Well, nearly a year and a half later, as expected a lot has happened....</p>

    <h2>Pitch Video Trailer Postmortem</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I was busy last month cutting together a trailer for… business purposes. I’ll talk more about this later. It turned out surprisingly more difficult that I had have hoped, but I found a rather unique way of pulling it together.
Obviously, the secret weapon is Fraps. Trying to nab constant 60fps footage was doable, but proved tricky, due to my hard drives not being the most defragged. I don’t know how many takes later, I ended up with nearly an hour of game footage, that was cut down to a 4 minute presentation....</p>
