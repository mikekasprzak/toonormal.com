  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Err… maybe that’s not the most appropriate post title.
Yes, spreading is what we’re doing. Since I’m a nice guy, and since it’s probably a bad idea to wait, I’ve released the supped up classic 2003 PuffBOMB Prototype to the public. A download link can be found at the ‘official’ PuffBOMB homepage, PuffBOMB.com.
Currently it’s only available for Windows. Hopefully, I can have the MacOS X version ready to go soon....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The round up is here. Hurah.
An underwater sequel to Cosmo Bots, a mech 3D shooter War World, Diablo meets Gauntlet in Evil Invasion, and a double dose of cavemen. An alright month. We’ve had better.
But wait! What is this? Bright red, black, orange and blue banners? Oh noes! What could this be? An add campaign for some wacky game? Inconceivable!...</p>

    <h2>IGF and PuffBOMB clones?</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Well, well. The IGF 2006 Entries are now online, and we have a PuffBOMB clone to duel with. Impulse. It appers to be, according to the description, pretty much the same idea. Lets quote.
 Impulse: The player must place bombs and adjust their timers to make a ball hit the goal field. Obstacles, special elements and force fields provide varied levels. An interactive timeline helps controlling the game by jumping to specific times and guarantees a flexible and unique gameplay....</p>

    <h2>There&amp;#8217;s a Slamdance too?</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Apparently I forgot about this. The Slamdance Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition is yet another IGF like compo. I don’t think it’s actually worth any prizes… at least none their publicizing. Either way, I’ve put together a publicity pack for them, and will be sending it off today. A shame that they’re making me pay to enter. Buh.
I think what turned me off about this “way back when” was that the game had to be profitless, but apparently that’s not the case anymore....</p>

  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Hmm, it seems I misplaced this blog post.
With less than 5 hours to spare, it’s in. Excellent. It wasn’t without it’s drama though. Once confirmed by myself, my brother, and a few friends that everything was good, I began to upload. *OH GOOD*, the upload server was acting up! Ack!
Within 20 minutes things cleared up. I snuck my game into it’s folder, hit the switch, and waited as it’s bytes were sucked out of Canada into some server likely in the California area....</p>

    <p>Clock is ticking.
Yep. In one sense, I’m ready to go. I filled out the submission for yesterday, and paid my entry fee. Apparently however, you need an installer. *Oh*. So today, after finishing the missing graphics, I got to do that. Huge thanks to Seth for sharing with me his NSIS script, which saved me hours of digging for little things like uninstaller cleanlyness, icon changing, and so many silly little things....</p>

    <h2>Blam!  Teaser</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So begins the campaign. PuffBOMB.com/.net/.org are now online with this wonderful tease site. I’ll have banners show up in the indie world soon, just to build some awareness. I have some big plans for this game.
IGF polishing goes well. Just a few more graphics, and some minor updates to the game itself, and we’re good to go.
2 days left. We’re looking good....</p>

    <h2>Scrambled Eggs</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>A bit of a last minute scramble to get something together for the IGF. My original idea of getting the new game up and running, hahahaha… erm, sadly no. Progress is good, but not that good. However, I still am sending something. What I’m sending is the old PuffBOMB, from over 2 years ago, with a fresh paint job. The new look finally brings together my style ideas for the game from the past couple years It’s a chance to finally see it in action, and to know, does it suck or not....</p>
