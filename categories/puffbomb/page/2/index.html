    <p>This posting has been filled. Thanks everyone.

Here’s a little job posting that I’ve started to circulate.
[edit] Edited, ’cause it was rather technical and mean sounding. – – – –
Hi there,
We’re looking for a skilled 2D illustrator or animator for a 2 month contract, to start some time in February. The work can be done remotely. This is a full time contract, and I expect it to be on par with industry wages....</p>

    <h2>Oh right, a compilation too</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>It seems I missed the memo.
The 2nd Independent Games compilation was released back in September (25th), and that PuffBOMB game I seem to talk about all the time was included.
As well, there was a set of concept art included in the package. Said art can also be seen right here.
I suppose I should go find a way to acquire a copy, ’cause I’m not sure what happened to a complimentary one....</p>

    <h2>PuffBOMB Concept Art 2003-2004</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Due to the request of a compilation Classic PuffBOMB will be a part of, I’ve collected various bits of concept art and sketches from 2003 and 2004. Given that the game was a solo effort, and completely dependent on my art skill, it’s no “Art of Warcraft 3″ style giant happy book of fantastic reference doodles. No sir. Instead, it’s just 4 collections of “learner artist” scribbles depicting some sort of character evolution....</p>

    <p>Well, I’m not going to let the month go by without posting something. After all, I have been doing much stuff. Not so much round up, but many many other things.
The project progresses. We’re busy preparing a pitch-able playable of the game that we’ll be pitchely pitching to potential pitch-able people pretty pitching soon. I’ll have less riddles and more to say about that in a few weeks.
Also, I’ve silently (and finally) put together a MacOS X version of PuffBOMB....</p>

A Sunset in Stone Which is probably quite warm, despite the cold imagery of anything in stone…… Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, I wanted an epic name to finish my cheesy little series of updates. Then it’s actual updates when they happen!!! Wow! That actually makes this a blog, instead of story time!
But I like story time … So back to the technical....</p>

    <p>Cream soda kung fu presents, part 6:
The Epic Tales of Hypocrisyism Viewer discretion is advised. So, right now, the current evolution of the character is this said goo blob thing. It shoots these tentacles/appendages out and swings, like any good monkey should.
However, for as long as I’ve been thinking about going with a gooey character, I’d been concerned about the Gishness factor. This “factor” is what I’m calling all the references to Gish....</p>

    <p>Hey there sports fans. Our epic saga continues with part 5:
The Character (or I’m a little tea pot why are you reading this sub heading like I have something insightful to say e-i-e-i-o) Last we left our hero, he was an eight legged insect. Now he’s an eight legged insect looking for a job!!!
Now, don’t get me wrong, he’s not a bad guy. You see, it’s not you, it’s me....</p>

    <p>So we have a character, and certain way the physics work. Cool. I want this game out reasonably soon, so that meant I needed to keep things simple. So minimal amounts of non functional stuff and no heavy animation. I don’t have an art team, just me. So the thought was to make the legs dangle and have shots of webbing shoot out.
And sure, this’ll make some nice still shots, but the character was going to be very nonfunctional looking....</p>

    <p>And the legend continues.
Now, a spider would make a rather cool game character. Especially in a game about swinging. So I toyed with some designs, keeping in mind a sphere’ish geometric character, as shown in the collision diagram above. The following are some results of that early concept work.
And a new one for good measure.
But despite the abundance of designs, I was running into a sort of dilemma coming up with some easy ways to make the character functional....</p>
