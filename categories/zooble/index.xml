      <description>Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve given names to game engines I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on. Most of my professional experience has been working on platformers and mini-game collections. Mini-games rarely share much in common, so by engines I&amp;rsquo;m referring to platformers, or engines for games very much like platformers.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to start talking about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about whilst designing my next engine. I need to set some context though, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be walking through some of more significant engines I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on.</description>

      <description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to let the month go by without posting something. After all, I have been doing much stuff. Not so much round up, but many many other things.
The project progresses. We&amp;rsquo;re busy preparing a pitch-able playable of the game that we&amp;rsquo;ll be pitchely pitching to potential pitch-able people pretty pitching soon. I&amp;rsquo;ll have less riddles and more to say about that in a few weeks.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve silently (and finally) put together a MacOS X version of PuffBOMB.</description>
