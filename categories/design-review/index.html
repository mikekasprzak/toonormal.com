  <div class="post-content"><p>An interesting concept for design people. I&rsquo;m calling them <strong>clicking platformers</strong>. Everybody&rsquo;s played Wik, so I wont talk about Wik. This is a game I came across today called Snakey Jake.</p>
<p><a href="http://charliedoggames.com/">Snakey Jake</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fejyh1HP4cY">YouTube Video</a>)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your usual casual game fare as far as graphics and polish are concerned. What I was expecting was a “click on a spot” sort of game and he&rsquo;ll move to that spot, but it&rsquo;s actually click on the platform and he&rsquo;ll move to the nearest place on the platform. Either by slithering or jumping, where appropriate. It&rsquo;s a good example of an intelligently simplified control scheme, as I expect several designers will be toying with more in the years to come.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t like this variation of control. True, it&rsquo;s harder to make mistakes since you can&rsquo;t click anywhere, but it annoys me as a player. Mostly because I&rsquo;m a core gamer, and I&rsquo;d imagine you could do some really interesting things with this gameplay style without the platform restriction. It also imposes a restriction of “you can only click on platforms that you can safely jump to from this platform”. Good for casual gamers, but not so much for me when I&rsquo;m in the mood for a suicide jump. I&rsquo;m also totally missing the opportunity for a conversation with myself about how I could or should have sooooo made that jump. Boo.</p>
<p>If I was still doing the roundup, I&rsquo;d be bouncing back and forth between 6 and 8. Higher because of design merit, &lsquo;cause I think it&rsquo;s a notable game as far as game design for casual gamers, and the only other game I can think of to compare it to is Wik. Lower because I personally didn&rsquo;t like the decision to go with platform clicking, as a personal gamer preference. I&rsquo;d muddle over that for a day if I wasn&rsquo;t behind schedule, or an hour if I was the one holding us back.</p>
