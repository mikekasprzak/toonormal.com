      <description>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I’ve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!
Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‘eh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).
The past week I’ve been busy with a variety of things.</description>

      <title>Smiles Drop New Years Sale, More</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2008/12/30/smiles-drop-new-years-sale-more/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2008/12/30/smiles-drop-new-years-sale-more/</guid>
      <description>Rather spontaneously, I decided to put Smiles Drop on sale for New Years.
So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab Smiles Drop for the extremely reasonable price of $1.99 (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy Smiles Zen after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on Smiles. Well… you might save a penny buying separately, but still.</description>

      <title>Finally, a weekend</title>

      <description>I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, “Smiles Drop”. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.
So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.
Wow… I think I can finally take a weekend off now.</description>

      <description>One thing lead to another, and I updated the Smiles website. It now has a fancy header, and a bit of a hint at what I’ll be up to in the coming weeks.

It also seems my press release/pack was picked up by 1up.

      <description>And that about wraps up marketing week.
After finishing and finally getting the video uploaded Sunday night, Monday began my marketing blitz.
The day started well, with the almighty Tim taking the first initiative and sharing the video.
http://www.indiegames.com/blog/…
The rest of the Think Services network picked up on the FingerGaming review as part of the usual syndication.
Game Set Watch | GamaSutra
And continuing with Think Services, I entered the game in the IGF Mobile.</description>

      <description>It’s late, now 5 AM Saturday morning. Release Candidate 1 is just a few hours away. Some achievement tweaks, and minor bugs and we’re good.
Should go out to Apple on Monday afternoon. Then probably a week and it’ll be live in the App Store.
I’d have taken a photo, but I’m currently cameraless.

The dummy website for the game:

Some time after it goes out, I’ll make a proper site.</description>

Might actually be at a week +/- a couple days now. That stuff above was important, and means the rest should be easy. Of course, *should* is a funny word.

      <description>Still doin’ the perpetual “one more week”, but I’m close. Very close. If things go according to plan, we’ll be beta next Monday (September 1st). I want to sit on it a couple days and test the crap out of it, just to be sure it’s all good. Then off to Apple by Wednesday-Friday.
I wanted the promo+box art done a couple weeks ago, but I amusingly keep pushing it back.</description>

      <description>Yikes, it’s a weekend again already! Sunday too! Ack!
Rule of thumb. When Mike says game will be out in a week or two, assume month. Then assume longer.
Ahem.
There’s always the chance that this mysterious iPhone game may destroy my ‘cred’ as a physics guy. Though, I’ve been doing some fun stuff in it to rectify that.
I’ve found several uses for effects based on verlet and spring physics, even though the game lives in a world of tiles.</description>

      <description>Slightly off topic today. Well, if you’re expecting mystery iPhone game news that is.
The weekend ended up being a little more slack-tastic that I’d hoped. Ludum Dare 12 after all, which always keeps me busy.
With only a couple hours left, I decided I’d throw something together quickly. Well, those couple hours went very well.
With so little time, I obviously couldn’t make anything extravagant. What I ended up with was a game best described as “a game designed to piss you off“.</description>

      <title>A cruel tease</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2008/08/02/a-cruel-tease/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2008/08/02/a-cruel-tease/</guid>
      <description>I must really enjoy being vague.
Three reasons for this. #1, I’m an ass. #2, The art is going through a major (final) overhaul at the moment. #3, I kinda don’t want my loyal viewer to pre-judge the game yet.
So the obvious answer, yes, it’s an iPhone game. Analysis of the mosaic well tell you a few things about the game, but to my credit, it’s not a clone. It’s a few things, but not a clone.</description>

      <description>August 1st, 2005. Three years ago this Friday. I was a burned out coder that left behind his jobs as Programmer, Senior and Lead Programmer, and eventually Technical Director at various game companies. A dozen handheld, mobile, and console titles to my name. A lifetime of game fascination and experience.
Next, I was starting my own.
Now, I’m not the only one of my former co-workers to do this, and certainly not the only one, but I didn’t want to do it the same as we’ve done before.</description>

      <description>Avert your eyes. Nothing to see here. Move along. I’m going to stop pretending I know when I’m ready to show. I’ve done several prototypes lately, but I’d rather talk about them with some context of what they lead up to.
So… maybe July. *sigh*
Oh, and Ludum Dare 12 will be August 8th weekend. Be there. </description>

      <description>I was really hoping to show what I’ve been up to these past couple months right about now, but it looks like that tease will have wait a few more weeks.
Something that is ready to go, albeit beta like, is the new Ludum Dare website.
http://www.ludumdare.com
The WordPress blog we’ve used for the last 2 compos has been migrated to dedicated hosting, and the ludumdare.com domain now points to it directly.</description>

      <description>I’ll get back to the series eventually. I was expecting to work and talk about new engine stuffs. Between some spontaneous stuff, taxes, and a week of illness, I’ve not touched anything “next” since early last month.
In other news, Ludum Dare 11 is this Friday. I’ve been too busy to really get involved, but Phil’s got things under control. Notice went out to the mailing list a good month or so early, and I’ve been mirroring the posts on a very default looking gamecompo.</description>

      <description>February 29th! How could I not say something today.
Just what to say is the question.
Blogging in the past, I’ve noticed the tendency to want to turn the blog in to something. A community, articles and subjects, talk-back, and all that stuff. And that’s great and all, but it’s a lot of work for not much return. Traditionally to make ends meet this way, you plaster your blog with advertisements, or actively soliciting contract work.</description>

      <description>Start the year right ‘eh?
I think each year I’ve had a blog, I’ve told myself “Yes sir! This year we’re going to blog more often… and it’s going to be great!”.
I’m not crazy enough to think that’s going to happen, but there’s always the intent. – – – –
Some fun code I toyed with over the past couple weeks, completely unrelated to each other. The VST SDK (audio instrument/effects) and the WinTab SDK (tablets).</description>

      <description>Yeah, sorry. I wanted to do detailed commentary of The Spider stuffs, the in between stuff, and get in to the new PuffBOMB stuff, but it looks like it didn’t happen. I wrote an outline and drafted a couple parts, but I wasn’t happy with the results.
“New PuffBOMB” has been down to just me since October. The artist finished his work, which turned out great. Richard got a job, and has been unavailable to help since.</description>

      <description>Before starting work on “The Spider”, I was building the engine for the “new PuffBOMB”. The concept behind the engine, 2D characters and physics, 3D backgrounds styled to look 2D, HD ready. Pretty standard stuff.
The concept behind “The Spider” is, unlike a normal platformer where you stand on the ground, this one you wouldn’t. Instead you would hang from and move along ceilings. The best idea I had at the time for pulling it off was something I nicknamed “double ropes”, one to support, and one for action.</description>

      <description>Pestering works. So it’s September now. Last time I gave a *real* update was a year and a half ago. A 7+1 part blog series titled “And the Project”, where I introduced what went in to a concept I called “The Spider”. You can read it here:
Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4
Part 5, Part 6, Part 7, Part “+1″
Well, nearly a year and a half later, as expected a lot has happened.</description>

      <description>The AO games rating seem to be the hot topic as of late, thanks to Rockstar’s Manhunt 2 initially netting the rating. The AO rating is terrible for game, because it excludes you from key retail outlets like Walmart.
But I want to bring your attention to something that’s generally being overlooked by these articles. Films in the same genre as the Manhunt game. Hostel and Saw. Torture films basically. Hey look!</description>

Here’s something interesting.
 The 2008 IGF Main Competition will again be open to all independent developers to submit their games – whether it be on PC, console digital download, Web browser, or other more exotic formats.
 Cool, but doesn’t that have to mean your game is already available/to be available by October?</description>

      <description>Last post talked about the random thoughts I’ve had about how to pull off the rope dynamics in Umihara Kawase, this classic SNES game that drives us all mad. I made some bold suggestions, and decided to try them. After a couple hours of work, while not as complete as I want, it’s far enough along to be able to demonstrate to me if I have a right idea or not.</description>

      <description>Raigan and I have had an extremely brief dialog on in game ropes. It makes sense, for a while we were both doing rope driven games.
Well, due to my failings as a communicator, I sort of just never got back to him. Yet, I absolutely love the topic, and certainly spent much time puzzled by it. Apparently I’ve also made the conscious effort to push my way in to obscurity.</description>

      <description>Hypothetical situation.
Note: Try to refrain from bombard me with requests yet, ’cause I know a lot of people already like this idea.
cough, I’m in London, Ontario, Canada.A typical game company places 10 or more people under the same roof. Office space rented out at the expense of the company. There’s a management hierarchy, one or more people responsible for business and infrastructure aspects of the company, and an arrangement of programmers, artists, designers, possibly testers and a sound guy.</description>

      <description>I think it’s an important direction and discussion for game design. Sure, as a gamer, I can handle complicated control schemes. I’ve done my time and held my own in hotkey crazy RTS’s, twitch FPS’s, and I can be pretty menacing in Tony Hawk. But most of these games aren’t getting any easier. I don’t even care to finish Tony Hawk’s Project 8, or the Underground games, because the things you need to do at the end are ridiculous.</description>

      <description>Hrmph. Strange.
Anisotropic filtering in OpenGL on NVidia cards finally started to work after switching from uncompressed to DXT3 compressed textures.

Anyone that’s followed my work probably won’t be miffed by that mean looking first word. But if you stuck around, you stuck around for my work, not my clever name. You probably have your own pronunciation of it too. I’ve certainly heard some interesting ones from telemarketers that whois’d my domains for a phone number.
Lets see if we are thinking the same thing.</description>

      <description>Ranting… I’m sorry. I suppose I’ve been “writing” music with trackers for about 13 years (Scream, Impulse, Modplug, Buzz, Renoise). Alas, my results have been less than satisfactory. I want to take this moment to apologize to everyone I ever recommended trackers to.
Sorry.
Sometime last month I set out to find a better music app. I’d already entered the world of VST’s thanks to Renoise, having put down a big $600 for Colossus.</description>

      <description>Here’s a fun point. Almost everyone works at a desk, but nobody talks about desks. Chairs come up sometimes, especially in discussions about the Aeron chair versus a well made leather, or general sitting ergonomics.
This is an incredibly broad topic that could easily span dozens of blog posts in it’s complexity. Game developers and other media professionals have many needs for their working surface. And depending on how many hats you wear as a developer, you’ve got to fit several monitors, speakers (stereo or surround), input devices (keyboards, mice, tablets, midi interfaces), scanners, printers, and other office friendly objects (fans, phones, paper and supplies) on it.</description>

      <description>This is part of a forum post I made. Classic Mike, going completely off topic and force feeding all the random advice I had saved up.
– – – –
Be sure your input update is written/recorded immediately before the game processes it. In other words, at the end your control interpretation code/handler. That way it can “in theory” reproduce a crash, instead of coming up a frame or two short.</description>

      <description>This is from a forum post I made in response to a question on testing methods. A classic Mike random advice assault. This branched off to a series of thoughts on built in game recorders.
– – – –
Free testing methods:
Peer testing has worked well for me, as developers tend to have bizarre PC configurations (multiple monitors, multiple gamepads, etc). There’s also a level of critique a developer can give that goes above and beyond, but you need to be clear and capable of asking for the harshest of critiques.</description>

      <description>From a forum post, a set of bullet point advice on creating a custom archive format.
– – – –
– For terms: Archives are a directory/dictionary/list of filenames with offsets to chunks, and many data chunks (files). Compression comes later.
– Directories and subdirectories are just longer filenames. Unlimited file name length means unlimited directories.
– Padding the start of data chunks to 4 byte boundaries has performance advantages on many platforms when in RAM.</description>

$8 gets you a day (about 6 hours of talks) for either the Indie Games Summit or the Casual Games Summit. Nice. Buy ‘em all for nearly 24 hours of interesting discussions and talks.</description>

      <description>The innovative games arms race is on.
http://gamevideos.com/video/id/9860
… Alright, I give up.
Normally when I see a really fantastic game like this, I’m all excited (Spore). This one drove me in to a brief game design depression. Now that’s emergent gameplay at it’s finest, and I’ve not even played the game.
Concepts like collaborative editing and modern user friendly editing. Two ideas I’ve been extremely excited about toying with. “Oh, we do them both”.</description>

      <description>Sitting in the home office, doing taxes. I came to the realization that the it’s one of those silly short February’s, and I hadn’t posted anything this month. I’ve been doing good as far as posts, with at least 1 thing to say every month. It’d be a shame to break that nice consistent list of dates on the right. Job postings work. We found somebody that seems perfect for the job below.</description>

      <description>I was busy last month cutting together a trailer for… business purposes. I’ll talk more about this later. It turned out surprisingly more difficult that I had have hoped, but I found a rather unique way of pulling it together.
Obviously, the secret weapon is Fraps. Trying to nab constant 60fps footage was doable, but proved tricky, due to my hard drives not being the most defragged. I don’t know how many takes later, I ended up with nearly an hour of game footage, that was cut down to a 4 minute presentation.</description>

Hey,
On the weekend of Jan 26-28 there will be an unofficial Ludum Dare warmup competition.
The compo will be held entirely in #ludumdare on irc.afternet.org. Final entries must be hosted on your own web space. Someone might put up a wiki, but that someone won’t be me – Theme choice will be discussed and voted on Jan 26 at 7pm PST.</description>

      <description>I like Slamdance. I entered PuffBOMB last year, and was a finalist for the casual game award. Since then, I’ve been excited that a more “artful” game competition was beginning to take off. Winners receive a funky ugly dog statuette. Cool! Then a controversial game was pulled. Things are not going well now.
It’s a real shame, and I hope something good comes from the controversy, rather than developing in to more Jack Thompson style heat for our industry.</description>

www.sykhronics.com
It’s not functional, but I think it looks cooler/more professional than before. I’ll make it usable at some later date.
Since it’s a new month, here’s a couple notable images from last month. The first is are a little sketch I did for each of my grandmother’s in their Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>You see, what’s fun about big computers is… oh wait… there’s no fun here.
Back sometime in ‘98, whilst I was working in a computer store, my fascination with big computer crap began. And I purchased this massive “Server” case, which was PC’s case for a couple years. Eventually, this behemoth of a case was “promoted” to an actual server, since routine maintenance/upgrades were painful given it’s shear mass.
Then in ‘04, I had the brilliant idea to purchase the biggest, fattest Laptop mankind has ever seen.</description>

      <description>I’m not going to pretend I got lots done. This month got off to a slow start. With Disgaea 2finally hitting our shores, and that inevitable peer pressure to play Oblivion, it seemed like the right thing to do.
But mixed in to a reasonably large game engine re-engineering effort, which always seems to be 2 weeks away from bearing fruit, there’s been my little project of art research or training, or whatever catchy “make art better” phrase I come up with at the time.</description>

The post is of similar quality and length to what I’d normally constitute a “blog post”, so I’m dropping it here so I don’t forget. It’s certainly not a surefire answer to anything, just a stroll through me solving a problem.
The set up: SVN, a great tool for backups, versioning, and synchronization, can and should be used in all aspects of development.</description>

No doubt you’ve heard about Microsoft’s big news that’s making Indie developers all giddy. $99 a year to “activate” an Xbox 360 so that you can test your games on it. Sounds great, but there’s 1 little thing that could pose a problem for some.
C#
… Alright. Nothing against C# as a language, ’cause I’m sure it’s a great and efficient once you get used to it.</description>

      <description>I guess I’ve been involved in games a long time. Doing “amazing” things with “PRINT” on the Commodore 64 at the age of 9, and promoting a cheesy Zelda/Final Fantasy hybrid online at 16. Just to give some perspective, the year was 1996, and the game was called Legends of Tidal, a game the Internet has forgotten. Then there was all that game industry experience, but pshaw, nobody cares about that.</description>

The project progresses. We’re busy preparing a pitch-able playable of the game that we’ll be pitchely pitching to potential pitch-able people pretty pitching soon. I’ll have less riddles and more to say about that in a few weeks.
Also, I’ve silently (and finally) put together a MacOS X version of PuffBOMB.</description>

      <description>Yup, I’m a few days behind mentioning this, but this month’s round up is up. A personal favorite of mine, Titan Attacks reigned supreme, followed by the slick steam powered airship game, Steam Brigade, and the un-noted but equally as surprisingly quality Inlay clone, Mosaic: Tomb of Mystery. Fun stuff.
As expected, I’m going to say things are going well with the game, despite the updates. Actually, better than well. Much Biz oriented stuff, which I’m going to have to sit on for a while.</description>

Yesterday had some good events. The IGF results were announced, and the evil forces of Darwinia ran away with most of the prize money. Curse you Darwinia, I will have my revenge! Sony also spilled the beans, announcing a service “like” Xbox Live Arcade, but neglects to invite Indie’s. How rude. And everyone’s talking about Duke Nukem Forever 2.
It’ll be tough to beat a day as grand as yesterday, but today is always looking for a challenge.</description>

I had the chance to contribute to an interesting conversation, about a world where developing games was illegal, and what you would do. Of course, it’s only appropriate I took the sarcastic “my life is ruined” angle. Allen from the Escapist approved, and posted this.

Sure it’s not front page news (except maybe for here), but it’s a small achievement I like to indulge myself in. Being a coder, I code a lot. Or at least, that’s what I’ve been doing professionally these past 6 years. So, I’m on a mission to improve my art and music skillzorz whilst on my adventures in independent game development. This little burning through a sketchbook challenge has been a constructive one for me.</description>

      <description>One way to know if you’re established on the net.
I can’t even remember what it used to recommend instead of Sykhronics, but I’m glad to have finally made an impact. Woo. </description>

      <description>February the 1st. I’m mere minutes away from missing this chance to post and make the first of this month, yet I prevail. Ha ha!
Hopefully, I’m finally getting my act together. We’re already a month in to 2006, and really I haven’t had much to show. It seems I’ve been in a less than ideal situation up until recently. It’s resolution was equally as not so idealistic, so excuse me as I be vague, until the day we all look back and laugh about it.</description>

      <description>Yes, it is certainly a newer year than before, and yet, I’m 3 weeks behind in declaring it as such. Ahh, this whole time thing you corporeal types take for granola.
I’m busy getting things in order on this side of screen. Big year, lots to do. Many sites that need work, and a game development crunch to kick off soon. Stay tuned. Check back every minute. ‘cmon, show my host how much you love it.</description>

      <description>Crud. This’d normally be a good place to stick an image, but that’s the problem.
Tuesday evening, I’m minding my own business playing a game on my laptop, when suspiciously my desktop PC reboots. I thought nothing of it, and continued playing. Several hours later, I’m shutting everything down for the night, and I find the desktop locking up in the Bios detecting the IDE devices. Whatever, we’ll look in to it in the morning.</description>

      <description>Whilst writing my recent post on the updated logo for the business transition of the branding, I was inspired to take a look at the progression of Sykhronics logos over the years. Some of the more recent logos are custom designed fonts, which is something I plan to again some day with the logo.
Kenny Thornton, and the guys at Execute (a long since abandoned group). Kenny was the only one to ever release anything under the branding, so it’s pretty much his.</description>

      <description>Yep, I died. No, wait.
I’ve been busy pulling a prototype together. I’m afraid I don’t have much to say just yet. I have a pretty ambitious goal to meet by the end of this month, and I’ll gladly talk about it then. I even brought on some help, as I think timing is crucial.
If this works out, we should see some PuffBOMB action in about a year.
I like consoles.</description>

      <description>Hurah! Finally open. Welcome. Come on in and hear me think.
At some point throughout the day I was working. Really, I was; You can trust me. My new (3rd) office whiteboard just arrived this morning. I took the liberty of violating it with some math/physics filth. It seems to be holding up well, which is good, as I expect many more shamefull acts of mathematics to be performed on it.</description>

      <description>Alright, we’ve got a nice backlog of posts to make this blog look meaningful now. I’ll quickly spruce up the logo, and sneak off to some magical forums claiming “Oh! Didn’t I tell you, I have a blog too! I can’t believe it never came up in conversation. Har Har Har”. Yes, it will be brilliant.
A new round up should be on the Tunnel soon. Russell was down in TV land promoting the site on Attack of the Show.</description>

      <description>Amazing. Today was my official last day at Big Blue Bubble. BBB was a great place to work, but I’m a too ambitious for my own good. So, lets see if I can make this happen.
The next couple weeks are some down time. Taking things easy, doing some organization, making backups, and so on. Being realistic, I’ve missed my chance to make the IGF. On the other hand, there’s still something this year I can shoot for.</description>

      <description>That’s right kids. It’s here. It’s begun. All that.
Why are we here?
Too Normal is my blog. Me, Mike, this questionably sane guy who makes games. Video games. That crazy amalgamation of visual and sonic goodness and a mighty tech chew. Too Normal is here to share my experience, observations and insight into what I do moving forward.
Who are you?
A “crazy” programmer with well over 5 years of commercial game programming experience, a dozen credits to my name, a history of programming and game development that goes back to when I measured my age with fingers, enough art skill that I get requests, a pair of credits doing voice acting (though I’m an awful actor), and several youthful years tracking music (this needs the most work).</description>
