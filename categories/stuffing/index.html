    <h1 class="post-title">Blogging for 5 years now&amp;#8230; wuh, really!?</h1>
    <div class="post-meta">Mike K ¬∑ May 9, 2010
    </div>
  </header>
  <div class="post-content"><p>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I‚Äôve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!</p>
<p>Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‚Äòeh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).</p>
<p>The past week I‚Äôve been busy with a variety of things. <a href="http://developer.palm.com/webChannel/index.php?packageid=com.sykhronics.smiles"><strong>Smiles for Palm Pre</strong></a> is available, and actually, I‚Äôve already submitted and had an update approved. So that‚Äôs looking good.</p>
<p>My focus the last few days has been building and setting up my new desk. I‚Äôm not quite done setting things up, so I‚Äôll hold off posting photos for now. My studio has/is acquiring a bunch of new furniture, so I‚Äôd like to get everything in and set-up before the tour. üôÇ</p>
<p>This year is also my big switch from <strong>Paint Shop Pro</strong> (for both raster and vector art) to <strong>Adobe CS5</strong> (Photoshop and Illustrator). CS5 Production Premium showed up earlier in the week, but I didn‚Äôt get a chance to sit down with it until yesterday. Alongside CS5 I picked up one of the 12‚Ä≥ Wacom Cintiq‚Äôs, since I imagine CS5 wont run well on my dated Tablet PC (Celeron). At GDC this year, I made a point of stopping by the Wacom booth to try out a Cintiq, to see if they had the same fuzzy-edge problem as my Tablet PC, which they do. Though after playing with the Cintiq for a couple days, the fuzzy-edges seem to distort less than the Tablet PC. Or it‚Äôs just ‚Äôcause it‚Äôs bigger, but either way, it‚Äôs a win.</p>
<p>Between all this fun, I‚Äôve been finishing my (updated) Windows and Linux ports for <a href="http://www.intelappup.com">AppUp</a>. I meant to have it done last weekend, but oh well, I guess I‚Äôm running behind. I replaced <strong>SDL_mixer</strong> with <a href="http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/"><strong>irrKlang</strong></a> today. SDL_mixer has a bug with looping OGG files (after looping, sound distortions creep in to the stream), and <a href="http://www.galcon.com">like Phil</a>, I need something that works now. The new irrKlang sound engine is working well as a drop in replacement on Windows, but I ran in to a slight problem on Linux, though I‚Äôm fairly sure it‚Äôs an easy fix. I get the impression <strong>irrKlang</strong> streams everything from disk, unless explicitly played from memory. Knowing my luck there‚Äôs a flag somewhere that says ‚ÄúCache sound in RAM‚Äù, but either way, it‚Äôs no trouble to load a file then pass it in. I‚Äôm mentioning this since I was expecting a similar setup to SDL_mixer (and certain other sound libraries), where WAV‚Äôs are stored in RAM, and OGG‚Äôs stream from disk. Apparently not, heh. It‚Äôs arguably a better design, but unexpected.</p>
<p>Also this week, <strong>Smiles HD</strong> was featured by Apple. Here‚Äôs a pic.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/SmilesHDFeatured.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>You could say I‚Äôve been looking forward to this for a year and a half now‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I have been. ;). So hooray! Smiles has <em>finally</em> been featured!</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been dancing around the 70‚Äôs on the top 100 grossing games chart most of the week. And if it could stay that high, that would be a pretty comfortable place for me earnings wise. Alas, this status of mine will be coming to an end Monday night. Still, it‚Äôs a welcome nod from the big A.</p>
<p>Once the AppUp builds of Smiles go out, the plan is to either get back on the <em><strong>Mystery Platform</strong></em> port, or a demo/lite version of the game. I sent a pitch out last week that could introduce an immediate <strong>3rd branch</strong> to this agenda, but we‚Äôll see.</p>
<p>As things stand, I‚Äôm probably looking at 2-3 months more Smiles work. There‚Äôs still some minor ports I may do, and always the possibility of one last big ‚Äúhoo-rah‚Äù port, but soon I‚Äôll be able to focus the my time almost entirely on the new game. With Palm done, AppUp nearly finished, my whiteboard list is clearing fast.</p>
<p>July, I‚Äôm coming for you!</p>

    <h2>Smiles Drop New Years Sale, More</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Rather spontaneously, I decided to put Smiles Drop on sale for New Years.
So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab Smiles Drop for the extremely reasonable price of $1.99 (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy Smiles Zen after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on Smiles. Well‚Ä¶ you might save a penny buying separately, but still....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, ‚ÄúSmiles Drop‚Äù. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.
So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.
Wow‚Ä¶ I think I can finally take a weekend off now....</p>

    <p>And that about wraps up marketing week.
After finishing and finally getting the video uploaded Sunday night, Monday began my marketing blitz.
The day started well, with the almighty Tim taking the first initiative and sharing the video.

The rest of the Think Services network picked up on the FingerGaming review as part of the usual syndication.

    <p>It‚Äôs late, now 5 AM Saturday morning. Release Candidate 1 is just a few hours away. Some achievement tweaks, and minor bugs and we‚Äôre good.
Should go out to Apple on Monday afternoon. Then probably a week and it‚Äôll be live in the App Store.
I‚Äôd have taken a photo, but I‚Äôm currently cameraless.

    <p>Yikes, it‚Äôs a weekend again already! Sunday too! Ack!
Rule of thumb. When Mike says game will be out in a week or two, assume month. Then assume longer.
Ahem.
There‚Äôs always the chance that this mysterious iPhone game may destroy my ‚Äòcred‚Äô as a physics guy. Though, I‚Äôve been doing some fun stuff in it to rectify that.
I‚Äôve found several uses for effects based on verlet and spring physics, even though the game lives in a world of tiles....</p>

    <p>Slightly off topic today. Well, if you‚Äôre expecting mystery iPhone game news that is.
The weekend ended up being a little more slack-tastic that I‚Äôd hoped. Ludum Dare 12 after all, which always keeps me busy.
With only a couple hours left, I decided I‚Äôd throw something together quickly. Well, those couple hours went very well.
With so little time, I obviously couldn‚Äôt make anything extravagant. What I ended up with was a game best described as ‚Äúa game designed to piss you off‚Äú....</p>
