  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Whilst writing my recent post on the updated logo for the business transition of the branding, I was inspired to take a look at the progression of Sykhronics logos over the years. Some of the more recent logos are custom designed fonts, which is something I plan to again some day with the logo.
Kenny Thornton, and the guys at Execute (a long since abandoned group). Kenny was the only one to ever release anything under the branding, so it’s pretty much his....</p>

    <p>Yep, I died. No, wait.
I’ve been busy pulling a prototype together. I’m afraid I don’t have much to say just yet. I have a pretty ambitious goal to meet by the end of this month, and I’ll gladly talk about it then. I even brought on some help, as I think timing is crucial.
If this works out, we should see some PuffBOMB action in about a year.
I like consoles....</p>

    <p>Hurah! Finally open. Welcome. Come on in and hear me think.
At some point throughout the day I was working. Really, I was; You can trust me. My new (3rd) office whiteboard just arrived this morning. I took the liberty of violating it with some math/physics filth. It seems to be holding up well, which is good, as I expect many more shamefull acts of mathematics to be performed on it....</p>

    <p>Alright, we’ve got a nice backlog of posts to make this blog look meaningful now. I’ll quickly spruce up the logo, and sneak off to some magical forums claiming “Oh! Didn’t I tell you, I have a blog too! I can’t believe it never came up in conversation. Har Har Har”. Yes, it will be brilliant.
A new round up should be on the Tunnel soon. Russell was down in TV land promoting the site on Attack of the Show....</p>

    <p>Amazing. Today was my official last day at Big Blue Bubble. BBB was a great place to work, but I’m a too ambitious for my own good. So, lets see if I can make this happen.
The next couple weeks are some down time. Taking things easy, doing some organization, making backups, and so on. Being realistic, I’ve missed my chance to make the IGF. On the other hand, there’s still something this year I can shoot for....</p>

    <p>That’s right kids. It’s here. It’s begun. All that.
Why are we here?
Too Normal is my blog. Me, Mike, this questionably sane guy who makes games. Video games. That crazy amalgamation of visual and sonic goodness and a mighty tech chew. Too Normal is here to share my experience, observations and insight into what I do moving forward.
Who are you?
A “crazy” programmer with well over 5 years of commercial game programming experience, a dozen credits to my name, a history of programming and game development that goes back to when I measured my age with fingers, enough art skill that I get requests, a pair of credits doing voice acting (though I’m an awful actor), and several youthful years tracking music (this needs the most work)....</p>
