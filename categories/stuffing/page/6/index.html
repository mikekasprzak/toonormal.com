    <h2>How to annoy the Internet</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>A condensed version of my previous post seemed to be making the rounds. It’s resulted in several interesting comments and additions from developers and gamers alike. I’ve decided to do your homework, and compile this list. Text in bold are the originals, with my comments in normal type.
Here we go.

    <p>So, that’s what happens on the 91’st day of the year shows up, your name is Mike, and you want to poke fun at casual gaming. You end up with a human body themed match 3, and an outrageous story that I don’t even want to rationalize. And yes, all Mike’s were thinking the exact same thing.
Yeah, this post is a rather plain one. Just a confirmation that yes, that was a joke, and an excuse to do an image dump....</p>

    <h2>Thursday Morning GDC 2k6</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Thursday, another big day at the Game Developers Conference.
Yesterday had some good events. The IGF results were announced, and the evil forces of Darwinia ran away with most of the prize money. Curse you Darwinia, I will have my revenge! Sony also spilled the beans, announcing a service “like” Xbox Live Arcade, but neglects to invite Indie’s. How rude. And everyone’s talking about Duke Nukem Forever 2.
It’ll be tough to beat a day as grand as yesterday, but today is always looking for a challenge....</p>

    <h2>In a future where dev is illegal</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Ahh the Escapist. A fine weekly online publication.
I had the chance to contribute to an interesting conversation, about a world where developing games was illegal, and what you would do. Of course, it’s only appropriate I took the sarcastic “my life is ruined” angle. Allen from the Escapist approved, and posted this.
 Turn to drugs, live on the street and sell myself cheaply to get by.

    <h2>Ritual Sacrifice</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Page 50. Two and a half months later.
Sure it’s not front page news (except maybe for here), but it’s a small achievement I like to indulge myself in. Being a coder, I code a lot. Or at least, that’s what I’ve been doing professionally these past 6 years. So, I’m on a mission to improve my art and music skillzorz whilst on my adventures in independent game development. This little burning through a sketchbook challenge has been a constructive one for me....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>February the 1st. I’m mere minutes away from missing this chance to post and make the first of this month, yet I prevail. Ha ha!
Hopefully, I’m finally getting my act together. We’re already a month in to 2006, and really I haven’t had much to show. It seems I’ve been in a less than ideal situation up until recently. It’s resolution was equally as not so idealistic, so excuse me as I be vague, until the day we all look back and laugh about it....</p>

    <p>Yes, it is certainly a newer year than before, and yet, I’m 3 weeks behind in declaring it as such. Ahh, this whole time thing you corporeal types take for granola.
I’m busy getting things in order on this side of screen. Big year, lots to do. Many sites that need work, and a game development crunch to kick off soon. Stay tuned. Check back every minute. ‘cmon, show my host how much you love it....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Crud. This’d normally be a good place to stick an image, but that’s the problem.
Tuesday evening, I’m minding my own business playing a game on my laptop, when suspiciously my desktop PC reboots. I thought nothing of it, and continued playing. Several hours later, I’m shutting everything down for the night, and I find the desktop locking up in the Bios detecting the IDE devices. Whatever, we’ll look in to it in the morning....</p>
