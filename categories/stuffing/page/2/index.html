    <h2>A cruel tease</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I must really enjoy being vague.
Three reasons for this. #1, I’m an ass. #2, The art is going through a major (final) overhaul at the moment. #3, I kinda don’t want my loyal viewer to pre-judge the game yet.
So the obvious answer, yes, it’s an iPhone game. Analysis of the mosaic well tell you a few things about the game, but to my credit, it’s not a clone. It’s a few things, but not a clone....</p>

    <h2>All aboard the Hype Train!</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>August 1st, 2005. Three years ago this Friday. I was a burned out coder that left behind his jobs as Programmer, Senior and Lead Programmer, and eventually Technical Director at various game companies. A dozen handheld, mobile, and console titles to my name. A lifetime of game fascination and experience.
Next, I was starting my own.
Now, I’m not the only one of my former co-workers to do this, and certainly not the only one, but I didn’t want to do it the same as we’ve done before....</p>

    <p>Avert your eyes. Nothing to see here. Move along. I’m going to stop pretending I know when I’m ready to show. I’ve done several prototypes lately, but I’d rather talk about them with some context of what they lead up to.
So… maybe July. *sigh*
Oh, and Ludum Dare 12 will be August 8th weekend. Be there. ...</p>

    <p>I was really hoping to show what I’ve been up to these past couple months right about now, but it looks like that tease will have wait a few more weeks.
Something that is ready to go, albeit beta like, is the new Ludum Dare website.
http://www.ludumdare.com
The WordPress blog we’ve used for the last 2 compos has been migrated to dedicated hosting, and the ludumdare.com domain now points to it directly....</p>

    <p>I’ll get back to the series eventually. I was expecting to work and talk about new engine stuffs. Between some spontaneous stuff, taxes, and a week of illness, I’ve not touched anything “next” since early last month.
In other news, Ludum Dare 11 is this Friday. I’ve been too busy to really get involved, but Phil’s got things under control. Notice went out to the mailing list a good month or so early, and I’ve been mirroring the posts on a very default looking gamecompo....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>February 29th! How could I not say something today.
Just what to say is the question.
Blogging in the past, I’ve noticed the tendency to want to turn the blog in to something. A community, articles and subjects, talk-back, and all that stuff. And that’s great and all, but it’s a lot of work for not much return. Traditionally to make ends meet this way, you plaster your blog with advertisements, or actively soliciting contract work....</p>

    <p>Start the year right ‘eh?
I think each year I’ve had a blog, I’ve told myself “Yes sir! This year we’re going to blog more often… and it’s going to be great!”.
I’m not crazy enough to think that’s going to happen, but there’s always the intent. – – – –
Some fun code I toyed with over the past couple weeks, completely unrelated to each other. The VST SDK (audio instrument/effects) and the WinTab SDK (tablets)....</p>

    <p>Yeah, sorry. I wanted to do detailed commentary of The Spider stuffs, the in between stuff, and get in to the new PuffBOMB stuff, but it looks like it didn’t happen. I wrote an outline and drafted a couple parts, but I wasn’t happy with the results.
“New PuffBOMB” has been down to just me since October. The artist finished his work, which turned out great. Richard got a job, and has been unavailable to help since....</p>

    <h2>The &amp;#8220;New&amp;#8221; Project, Part 1</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Before starting work on “The Spider”, I was building the engine for the “new PuffBOMB”. The concept behind the engine, 2D characters and physics, 3D backgrounds styled to look 2D, HD ready. Pretty standard stuff.
The concept behind “The Spider” is, unlike a normal platformer where you stand on the ground, this one you wouldn’t. Instead you would hang from and move along ceilings. The best idea I had at the time for pulling it off was something I nicknamed “double ropes”, one to support, and one for action....</p>

    <p>Pestering works. So it’s September now. Last time I gave a *real* update was a year and a half ago. A 7&#43;1 part blog series titled “And the Project”, where I introduced what went in to a concept I called “The Spider”. You can read it here:
Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4
Part 5, Part 6, Part 7, Part “&#43;1″
Well, nearly a year and a half later, as expected a lot has happened....</p>
