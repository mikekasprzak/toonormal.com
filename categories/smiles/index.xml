      <description>Hey look what finally came out!

Hey look! Somebody liked it! Oh wait, that was me
Here&amp;rsquo;s a video.
  Without spoiling it, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with how it&amp;rsquo;s selling so far. üòÄ</description>

      <description>Progress on the tech for my upcoming game ‚ÄúAlone, The‚Äù has been a little slow the past couple weeks, due to Ludum Dare, a nightmare of server issues (both LD and my own), and my upcoming move (OMG THAT&amp;rsquo;S RIGHT NOW). I have some great news to share though:

      <description>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I&amp;rsquo;ve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù.</description>

      <description>I did miss my June 23rd target date, but with good reason: I started on computer upgrades and setting up my new Laptop early. üòÄ
But yes, as you approach the end of something, there are always things you forget about that still need to be done.
Like this, a Computer and TV-System appropriate trailer for Smiles HD (i.e. without entire screen rotating):
  As you can see, that is now done.</description>

      <description>Yes, you read that right. It is ending. For real.
June 23rd is the 3 year anniversary of Smiles (as in, starting the game). I have finished every single port of the game that I had planned on doing (except console ports, both I decided to abort); Some are still in submission or need of final packaging. Days away now.
Today is June 15th, a whole week away from the anniversary.</description>

      <description>Speaking of better, here&amp;rsquo;s the final gameplay trailer for Kindle Smiles:
  That is submitted and in the queue now. Should be available in the Amazon Kindle store soon.
BONUS! I recorded a brief ‚Äúmaking-of‚Äù video, showing how recording the footage for the above video would look.
  Now that Smiles is finally winding down, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to do more little things like this.</description>

      <description>Hey, well that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Smiles for WP7 after a couple weeks.
Note, that&amp;rsquo;s cumulative&amp;hellip; which means total overall
Or according to my data: 9 trial downloads, and 1 sale since. There was some twitter talking, some retweets by fellow devs, but there&amp;rsquo;s practically no noticeable spike.
Ah well, so much for that. On to bigger better things.</description>

      <description>Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my ‚ÄúMicrosoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account‚Äù yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.
I made this game (Smiles), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:
  It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?</description>

      <description>Looks like the Symbian^3 versions of the game went live this morning in the Ovi store.
The full game Smiles you see there is for Maemo devices&amp;hellip; i.e. the N900. Zen+Drop are for Symbian
A 5-star positive review of both games so far. Excellent!
I&amp;rsquo;m writing up a nice long post (to follow) about the new game. Hopefully finished soon.</description>

      <description>Finally! Go take a look!

The &amp;lsquo;No Android&amp;rsquo; Smiles era has ended. Welcome to the era of Android Smiles.
https://market.android.com/developer?pub=Sykhronics+Entertainment
To say the Android port has was the most requested would be an understatement. I sent messages to the list of starred people in my e-mailbox, everyone that ever asked about the Android version&amp;hellip; I hope I got everyone. It feels good to finally have this covered. Ahhh!
There are 2 versions of the game available.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making games for a really long time now, but one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself rather resilient to was letting myself use Middleware. By Middleware, I mean 3rd party libraries. It&amp;rsquo;s funny since I always highly recommend that people use it (to save RIDICULOUS amounts of time), but I myself am just a really slow adopter of it.
SDL is one of few long-time 3rd party libraries I use. It lets me write my game code against the PC, Mac, Linux, and a few mobiles including Palm/HP&amp;rsquo;s webOS and Nokia&amp;rsquo;s Maemo.</description>

      <description>Happy April 1st!
To start, my thing to make you laugh.
  I&amp;rsquo;ll be finishing this up in the coming weeks. I had to prioritize some stuff ahead of it due at the end March (another reason I&amp;rsquo;ve been so quiet post GDC). There was also a faux pas on my part, but nothing too big&amp;hellip; I just have to drive down to the US border and activate a 2nd gen Kindle.</description>

      <description>2011 is here! The IGF finalists have been announced, CES is upon us, and GDC is less than 2 months away. I always have a hard time following up epic posts like the last one. So with this, my third attempt (ahem), I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to be more to the point: My plans for the year.
First, the Mac App Store launches on Thursday&amp;hellip; I wonder if Mike did something for that?</description>

      <description>Added a toggle button for Windowed and Fullscreen today, and made it actually work. I also did some tweaking of the icons around the edge of the screen (pushed them higher, made the outlines more consistent).
One of these days I need to align the outside UI stuffs to the edge of the screen
The About/Credits screen icon is now a speech bubble (was a ‚Äú?‚Äù, so not to confuse it with the help menu).</description>

      <description>I am a regular twitter user. I run a client (twhirl) in the corner of my right monitor, so for me it works like a weird combination of an IM client and RSS reader.
A couple days ago, I caught glance of this request from Noel Llopis (developer of Flower Garden, Dr. Seuss&amp;rsquo; Lorax Garden, and the upcoming Casey‚Äôs Contraptions).

That&amp;rsquo;s a good question. As far as I know there&amp;rsquo;s no real ‚Äústandard‚Äù achievement sound (unless you want to rip-off Microsoft).</description>

      <description>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It&amp;rsquo;s been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me ‚Äî I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I&amp;rsquo;m there.</description>

      <description>So I spent the evening getting Smiles working in 64bit Linux (Ubuntu 10.10) as well as the Mac. Here are the results:
Smiles HD, 64bit binary running on &amp;lsquo;The Zotac&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop
And the Mac again:
Smiles HD on the Mac again, this time in 64 bits
And a closeup of the processes section:

      <description>Before I get to the meat of this post, last night I finished my ‚Äúearly‚Äù Mac App Store TODO list. I *COULD* submit it now, but there&amp;rsquo;s a bug with submissions. My iPad version is called Smiles HD, and so will be the Mac App Store version. Right now the names conflict, so I have to wait until this is fixed.
For now it&amp;rsquo;s ‚Äúdone‚Äù. I sent the binary to some friends to double-check compatibility.</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/11/10/as-expected-twas-the-cache/</guid>
      <description>Not much to say or show, just that the performance problem was due to the textures being larger than the texture cache.
Under 10% CPU usage, much better
As it is now, on my Mac mini the game runs at under 8% CPU usage in the menus and Zen, and under 10% in Drop. The largest texture is 1024√ó1024, DXT5 compressed (4:1, or 1 MB). Before it was 1024√ó1024 uncompressed 32bit RGBA (1:1, or 4 MB).</description>

Yesterday was spent trying to get a 64bit version of Ubuntu running on my Media Center PC (i.e. my old dual core AMD workstation PC, now hooked up to the projector). My initial attempt of installing it to a USB key didn&amp;rsquo;t work, but I did eventually get it working using WUBI.</description>

      <description>Going through my Smiles HD TODO/Wishlist, one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to add to the game for a long time was a minimize button. The game runs on several multitasking OS&amp;rsquo;s, but your only option up until now was to exit. Now, if the OS supports it, it can be suspended in to the background with just a click.
The Exit and Minimize buttons on Windows and Linux
While adding the minimize button, I looked to the Mac to get an idea what it should look like (actually, I was queuing up the latest Xcode when I noticed it).</description>

      <description>Well alright. I agreed to do a little contract gig back during the summer that finally caught up with me, so the past couple weeks were spent on that. Yesterday we finally finished and submitted that, so I&amp;rsquo;m free to work on what&amp;rsquo;s really important: Smiles HD for computers!
Wait&amp;hellip; what!?
Okay, well I still do have my new-game scheduling plans detailed in the last post, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be slightly delaying that start time yet again, but not by much.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now half way through the month, and progress on my ‚ÄúOctober Game‚Äù is minimal to say the least. I suppose that was to be expected, since I did have several things to finish this month. My week-days have been filled with various tasks, leaving only weekends to work on this new thing. Next week I&amp;rsquo;ll be busy with my ‚Äú1 more thing‚Äù, leaving me the last week of October for a final crunch.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll have to make sure I fix/change the spacing when I do an update. Words got crammed.
I quite like the aesthetics of the Zune WP7 Marketplace. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to see, but the background is this large panoramic image I whipped up. The panorama looks pretty sweet on the phone. Whomever was responsible for the Zune and WP7 phone graphic design, it&amp;rsquo;s some fine work. Hats off to you sir.</description>

      <description>Since the summer I&amp;rsquo;ve been chatting with Microsoft about bringing Smiles to Windows Phone 7.
In early September, I was invited to an event ‚ÄúWindows Phone 7 Blogger Night‚Äù in Toronto.
Typical me, blurry and in motion. Here I am demoing Smiles on the TV (all of the touch-screen PC&amp;rsquo;s were taken). Also, note to self: don&amp;rsquo;t wear shorts to press events&amp;hellip; you stand out too much in the after event photography.</description>

      <description>So here&amp;rsquo;s that news: Smiles is coming to Windows Phone 7!
Here&amp;rsquo;s proof.
And here&amp;rsquo;s a snap of the game running on a completely different Windows Phone device, an LG.

      <description>One of the items on my seemingly infinite TODO list is to write an article about how to port an iPhone game to AppUp. Another item is to rework my blog layout and list all the actually useful content written here. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to do either, but I think I have here a good compromise for the 1st.
I do a-lot of emailing, and this past week I had a chat with a fellow developer who wanted some advice on porting his game.</description>

      <title>The final mobile port (for now)</title>

      <description>I actually finished on Sunday, but the final mobile port of Smiles is now sent. The port is for Samsung&amp;rsquo;s Bada mobile platform. I was pleasantly surprised how straight forward it was to get things up and running there. The system API is very much like a C++ version of Apple&amp;rsquo;s ObjC iPhoneOS API. The whole endeavor took no more than 4 days worth of work.

      <description>So finally, Smiles 1.1 for Netbooks (The Intel AppUp Center) has been submitted. Also, though Moblin Netbook Smiles was submitted last week, it came back with a very minor issue. That is now fixed, and sent as well. So Netbook Smiles == all done.
Moblin 2.1 running on the USB key
I have 1 last mobile port I&amp;rsquo;m doing, Samsung Bada. Again, Google wont let Canadians make Google Checkout Merchant accounts, so Android and NACL Smiles ports will be pending that, and a good motivator for each.</description>

      <description>The latest in the seemingly endless stream of ports (the first of the two implied quicker ports I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;hellip; though the 2nd one is sounding not so quick after all).
The N900 is a Linux (Maemo) based device, so I was literally able to pick up where I finished the Moblin (Linux) ports.
Admittedly, it was a bit of a scary port, since I was only initially able to get the game to do about 10 fps.</description>

      <description>Heh, I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting this.
Pay no attention to the grammar tense of the first sentence
RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I&amp;rsquo;m now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using UltraVNC on my PC&amp;rsquo;s recently, though I do run their iPhone client. üòâ

So to make that happen, I need to power through my list of pending platforms I want to cover, before back-burner&amp;rsquo;ing the rest.</description>

      <description>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I&amp;rsquo;ve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!
Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‚Äòeh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).
The past week I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with a variety of things.</description>

      <description>One of the sessions I saw at GDC this year was Palm&amp;rsquo;s talk about their new PDK (i.e. their native SDK). The promise was a Linux based mobile device featuring SDL and OpenGL ES. Since my Windows and Linux code base also uses SDL and OpenGL, that certainly caught my attention. In theory, all I need to do is just recompile my Linux version with their tools and I&amp;rsquo;m done, right?</description>

      <description>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel&amp;rsquo;s AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement.</description>

      <description>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I&amp;rsquo;ll talk a little more about the ‚Äúday 1 FREE‚Äù experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device.</description>

Remember: Smiles HD is FREE *ONLY* until the end of the day April 3rd! Regular price, $4.99. I think you&amp;rsquo;ll agree, it&amp;rsquo;s worth at least that.</description>

As we speak I&amp;rsquo;m putting the finishing touches on Smiles HD, the all new higher resolution and slightly redesigned iPhone game coming soon to the iPad.
Now, in the eyes of Apple I&amp;rsquo;m nobody special. So like many of you, I&amp;rsquo;ll be heading down to my local Apple store on launch day to pick me up an iPad&amp;hellip; with one slight difference.</description>

      <description>So, holy cow! GDC was absolutely insane! I almost don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start, but lets start from the beginning.
First thing first, I won again!!
Argh! They used that squished photo again! I even sent them a square one!
Yes, as if winning a free car wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, I also won a free trip to GDC. So Intel ended up covering my flight, putting me up in a fancy hotel, gave me some spending money, treating me to dinner, AND giving me nearly front row seats to a San Jose Sharks hockey game!</description>

      <description>Ordinarily, greeting someone by glancing at their chest might be seen as a little rude (especially a lady), but at GDC it&amp;rsquo;s encouraged! Yes I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the passes, not making a pass.
The passes do a good job of helping you connect a face to a name, and even a company, but you don&amp;rsquo;t always know who made or represents what. GDC passes include a relatively large pocket, so you could either make something to insert behind your name card, or cover the pass with some strategically placed stickers.</description>

      <description>So last year, I was an IGF Mobile finalist. This little game of mine stood alongside iPhone favorites like Edge and Fieldrunners, vying for the ‚ÄúBest Mobile Game‚Äù award. And if I had won, &amp;hellip; well, I have no idea. Even just being a finalist has been great for me, so I&amp;rsquo;d image it would have been MORE great. üòâ
That was 2009, and this is 2010.
This year started out as my ‚Äúlow key‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù GDC.</description>

And hey, guess what?
Advice: whenever somebody asks for a photo, send a square one, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t ask for square.

Second place! That&amp;rsquo;s awesome. üòÄ

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure this will surprise no one, but yes I&amp;rsquo;ll be releasing Smiles HD for iPad.
The iPad port will be based on my current Smiles code running on Netbooks and some Windows Mobile devices (Samsung Omnia II), but I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of adding several more enhancements on top of that. I&amp;rsquo;ll dive in to more of the specifics as iPad launch gets closer.
The biggest different between iPhone Smiles and my current code is I&amp;rsquo;ve squared the playfield (was 9√ó8, now 8√ó8) and added rotation buttons.</description>

http://www.intel.com/consumer/products/appup.htm
The store is very new and beta. It&amp;rsquo;s designed specifically for Netbooks and the OEMs that make them, but is freely available to for everyone to test and purchase from. Me personally, I had to install .NET 3.5 and .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 on my Aspire One to make it work.</description>

I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where to start, so I ended up categorizing aspects of the year. I&amp;rsquo;ll free form rant about each topic as I come to it.

I imagine the English versions will be available soon. Samsung&amp;rsquo;s approval department might be taking xmas off though. üòâ
Happy Holidays folks!</description>

      <description>Well, I can relax now. üôÇ
I have the results back from the Samsung contest, but I can&amp;rsquo;t say how that went &amp;hellip; yet. There&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be a proper winners announcement deal on SamsungApps Thursday, so if I have anything to add, I&amp;rsquo;ll do it then.
So that&amp;rsquo;s one thing off my mind.
The other thing off my mind is Intel&amp;rsquo;s contest. Netbook ports were due today, the same day as the results for Samsung.</description>

      <description>Wow. To say the last 3 weeks have been busy would be an understatement.
First of all, I ported Smiles to a new phone. The Samsung Omnia II, a Windows Mobile phone with a beautiful amoled screen and a custom GPU. Some photos.
What&amp;rsquo;s Windows without a Registry Editor
Some Avalanche&amp;hellip; a little blury though.
Itz-a me! Zen in Italiano!
For those keeping score, the game unfortunately runs a little slow on the Omnia II.</description>

      <description>An intense month of work awaits. Crunch time, and then some!
Early/Mid last week, I spec&amp;rsquo;d out the plan for my time between now and GDC. Quite a busy schedule, with a lot of really cool things coming up. Smiles stuff, and a quick collaboration with a friend, which I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about later. I should have plenty to talk about with my internet colleagues in March.
But the icing on the cake was a development Wednesday/Thursday of last week.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, awesome C an C++ language features you&amp;rsquo;ll learn to love in GCC, that&amp;rsquo;ll break your heart if you ever have to use Visual Studio. üòâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a list I collected whilst getting my Smiles PC code to compile with Visual Studio 2008. Most have no equivalent in Visual Studio, but one simply has a slightly different syntax (compatible too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, long and technical. Hit the link if you&amp;rsquo;re up for the challenge. You&amp;rsquo;ve been warned. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is not what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to all year, but it is what I&amp;rsquo;m up to right now.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s introduce the project.
Officially, the project is named Smiles. Specifically though, the project&amp;rsquo;s working title is Smiles PC. Just as you&amp;rsquo;d expect, it&amp;rsquo;s Smiles the iPhone game for PC, Mac and Linux. Actually it&amp;rsquo;s more than that, but lets stick with this for now.
At it&amp;rsquo;s core, Smiles PC is about removing the dependencies of the iPhone from the game.</description>

      <description>As planned, Smiles Zen 1.3 and Smiles Drop 1.3 were sent late Friday night (technically 5 AM the next day). I made the mentioned addition of arrows after discovering some people didn&amp;rsquo;t realize you could click on the icon. Here&amp;rsquo;s a snap of that from the iPhone build on the PC.
Cross promotion, now with arrows!
I had some friends look at this screen, and got a good reaction from the ‚Äúlove hearts‚Äù, so I made a similar change to free version.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something I hope to start doing more often. Technically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hoping to actually start all year. Short development video logs.
Today&amp;rsquo;s video is a demonstration of the cross promotion features in Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop. Inspiration hit last night, and I added something amusing to it I&amp;rsquo;d thought I&amp;rsquo;d share.
Both builds should go out tonight. I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding a pair of arrows beside the icon, just so it&amp;rsquo;s even clearer that you can click on it right here.</description>

      <description>Smiles 1.3 is already in the Apple queue, but not Zen and Drop yet. Something ‚Äúnew‚Äù in 1.3 is that I removed the ‚Äúhow to play music‚Äù instructions from the game. This used to be in the upper right corner of the screen. The description used to say you could ‚Äúdouble tap‚Äù the home button to bring up music playback, but it seems that was wrong on the iPhones and 3rd gen iPods.</description>

      <description>Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the launch of Smiles.
&amp;hellip;
Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s been that long already.
This weekend I&amp;rsquo;m giving Smiles Zen away for FREE. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve discounting Smiles to $1.99 to reflect the price. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s how we celebrate 1 year on iPhone. üòâ
In other news, Smiles 1.3 is on the way. I discovered a graphics performance bug on the newer iPhones and iPods (SGX), so that is now fixed.</description>

      <description>The title says it all. Finally, after 10 months in the App Store, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try out the infamous 99 cent iPhone price with Smiles.
I sent an early pre-release note to some of the iPhone press, as well as my twitter. So far it&amp;rsquo;s been picked up by Touch Arcade which is always a good place to start.
I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful. The new trailer is out there in the wild now, and-a&amp;hellip; now we wait.</description>

      <description>Yes yes, I&amp;rsquo;m awfully quiet. What else is new?
Let me tell you.
First things first, a brand new trailer for Smiles.
Why does Smiles need a new trailer? I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you when you&amp;rsquo;re older.
This ended up taking a couple weeks longer than I&amp;rsquo;d hoped it would (spontaneous summer vacation?), but it&amp;rsquo;s done. The new trailer combines the tidbits dropped in the last post (mushroom animation, new logo), some gameplay footage, and a nice audio track.</description>

As you can see above, my three complimentary copies showed up in the mail today. Word from the Dread Pirate himself (i.e. Lead Author/Tech Reviewer) is the books should be en route, if not already arriving at book stores all over the place. After all, the guy in Canada got his. üòâ

      <description>Smiles has been available for nearly 6 months in the App Store now. From the stories you may have heard, not all iPhone titles necessarily do well. But if you consider that the game was developed by one person in 4 months, it lives under the charts, and has only 1 Apple mention to it&amp;rsquo;s name, it&amp;rsquo;s actually done alright. I&amp;rsquo;m hardly ‚Äúrolling in the dough‚Äù, but I can make ends meet.</description>

      <description>Just a few hours ago I could barely move. Nearly crawling my way out of bed to attack the day (ahem&amp;hellip; night), after the long flight home.
I&amp;rsquo;ve since returned to my regular routine of pacing around my studio (i.e. basement), between moments of awe e-mailing and ranting everywhere it seems appropriate (forums, twitter). As I exhausted all those wonderful forms of communication, it seemed to be right time to start the required retrospective post.</description>

      <description>Friday was the short day. Wednesday and Thursday we exhibited 10-6, where Friday was 10-3. Went back to the hotel and vegged that day, before heading back out to hang with the Fantastic Contraption guys.
My neighbors were the Secret Exit guys. I ended up spending a bulk of the show goofing off with Tuukka, an artist on Zen Bound. The Secret Exit guys refer to him as the ‚Äúprankster‚Äù of the bunch.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a few photos of the completed setup.
And a little closer.
I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale.</description>

As you may or may not have heard, I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. But that&amp;rsquo;s alright, I&amp;rsquo;m still here to exhibit.
We&amp;rsquo;re sharing booth space with the IGF main competition entrants, which is great. That way, when people come to see the cool IGF games, they&amp;rsquo;ll find us too. Here&amp;rsquo;s my slice.
Other cool stuff, Apple put up a page of us IGF Mobile entries. Very awesome.</description>

      <description>The first step with Smiles was to up the art resolution. That way, I could cleanly resize to any resolution below 4x the iPhone (1920√ó1280).
Unfortunately, double and quadruple iPhone res are not practical resolutions. Double iPhone will work windowed on most desktop LCD and 720p screens (960√ó640), and quadruple in a window fits on a 30‚Ä≥ Dell or Apple Cinema display, but we could do better.
Also, not all screens are the same shape, but the solution isn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult.</description>

      <description>Alright, I don&amp;rsquo;t see a reason not to talk about this publicly. So if I&amp;rsquo;m a good boy, I&amp;rsquo;ll be walking through my process of up-scaling, converting, and porting Smiles as it happens. Ideally, I&amp;rsquo;d like to have the game available for all 3 desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Quickly, Smiles is an IGF Mobile nominated collection of puzzle games for iPhone. You can learn more about the game at smiles-game.</description>

Rebuilt the texture atlas&amp;rsquo; for the weather and vegetables tilesets, and resized the majority of the in game assets. 3x&amp;rsquo;d the iPhone res instead of 4x&amp;rsquo;d, as that would be far too huge.
Art is large enough for 1080p, but the game needs numerous changes to properly support the new aspect ratio(s).</description>

Between now and then, I have a few commitments to take care of. Possibly a 2nd draft for my writing engagement, jury (selection?) duty, in addition to IGF preparations. It&amp;rsquo;s also an important turning point for Smiles as a product and a brand.¬†Lets talk about that.</description>

      <title>Physics in Smiles</title>

      <description>At first glance you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think a matching game like Smiles would feature physics, but it does. In several places actually.
The most obvious example is the particle effects.
Particles were used when ice and rocks break, and also for the tile clearing effect. The tile would be erased instantly from the board, and a particle would be created in it&amp;rsquo;s place. The particle would zoom in, slow down, then zoom out with a twist.</description>

      <description>I kept video of some of my more interesting bugs/glitches/oddities in Smiles. Some more silly than others.
The first I want to show is a bug in one of the effects for the game mode Zen. It was supposed to be a ‚Äútoss a rock in to a pond‚Äù water ripple. It didn&amp;rsquo;t really work as expected.

Here&amp;rsquo;s what it was supposed to look like. Cool looking, but the problem with this was the effect would make you queasy.</description>

      <description>Rather spontaneously, I decided to put Smiles Drop on sale for New Years.
So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab Smiles Drop for the extremely reasonable price of $1.99 (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy Smiles Zen after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on Smiles. Well&amp;hellip; you might save a penny buying separately, but still.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 weeks, and much has happened.
As the topic suggests, Smiles Drop and Smiles Zen are now both available. $2.99 each, or save $1 by getting Smiles ($4.99).
So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out. As for blog content, I&amp;rsquo;m half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days&amp;hellip; and I sorta haven&amp;rsquo;t gone back to finish the post yet.</description>

      <description>I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, ‚ÄúSmiles Drop‚Äù. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.
So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.
Wow&amp;hellip; I think I can finally take a weekend off now.</description>

      <description>Part one of my rebellion against the iPhone price drop madness has begun. Smiles Zen, the standalone version of Zen is now sent to Apple.
If everything goes according to plan, it will be released bright and early Tuesday morning. This time, I explicitly set the date.

The day started well, with the almighty Tim taking the first initiative and sharing the video.

The rest of the Think Services network picked up on the FingerGaming review as part of the usual syndication.

      <description>London, Ontario, Canada ‚Äì November 12th, 2008
Sykhronics Entertainment would like to introduce, Smiles. A brand new game now available for iPhone and iPod touch.
Smiles is a collection of 2 great games.
Smiles Drop is an unconventional action puzzle game. Unlike many others, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait to make your next move. In addition, you&amp;rsquo;re not pressured in to making that move either. Play at your own pace. Make matches, break ice and rocks, twisting and turning your way to higher scores.</description>

      <description>Final version of the Smiles video. It&amp;rsquo;s the short one again, but with me talking.
Here&amp;rsquo;s your chance to hear and mock Mike. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting a number of positive and amusing comments from the video. Such fun things as that I sound like an Infomercial host, and music sounds like ‚Äúcorporate training music‚Äù. Finishing this video has been an incredible hassle. Hard drives dying, frequent reboots, loss of WAV file playback in Windows, and YouTube difficulties.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m still working diligently to assemble my complete press package. Putting the final touches on that video, writing the press release, e-mails, all that fun stuff.
But as part of my procrastination routine, I&amp;rsquo;m hitting my usual list of sites. IndieGames, ‚ÄúThe Sauce‚Äù, etc. And as I get to the iPhone gaming sites, I&amp;rsquo;m hit with this euphoric stupor.

      <description>Just got back from the grocery store, and got the word. ‚ÄúReady for Sale‚Äú.
http://appshopper.com/games/smiles
Search for ‚ÄúSmiles‚Äù and scroll down a bit, or browse the puzzle or strategy categories in iTunes.
Contrary to the description, it&amp;rsquo;s an Action Puzzler. Lumines/Metoes ‚Äòesc, or Bejeweled on crack.
Thanks to some fancy design kung fu, it&amp;rsquo;s also what the description says. But that&amp;rsquo;s a topic all in itself.

As of 7:45 AM this Tuesday October 28th morning, the game is now sent.

Digging through my SVN logs for some stats.
Repository was created on June 22nd, 2008. That&amp;rsquo;s a total of 4 months and 6 days.
All code, art (except the original TTF font, though I did design and make the logo text), and audio created by me.</description>

      <description>Wow, it&amp;rsquo;s been so long.
The last game I did TRC for was Atomic Betty, the Gameboy Advance game I worked on before leaving Big Blue Bubble. That would have been some time during July of 2005. That finished up, and I was a free man for August 1st.
By TRC I mean Technical Requirements Checklist. Every platform holder has them, though they sometimes have a different name for them. A TRC is a combination of guidelines.</description>

Should go out to Apple on Monday afternoon. Then probably a week and it&amp;rsquo;ll be live in the App Store.
I&amp;rsquo;d have taken a photo, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently cameraless.

I want to sit on it a couple days and test the crap out of it, just to be sure it&amp;rsquo;s all good. Then off to Apple by Wednesday-Friday.

      <description>Yikes, it&amp;rsquo;s a weekend again already! Sunday too! Ack!
Rule of thumb. When Mike says game will be out in a week or two, assume month. Then assume longer.
Ahem.
There&amp;rsquo;s always the chance that this mysterious iPhone game may destroy my ‚Äòcred&amp;rsquo; as a physics guy. Though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some fun stuff in it to rectify that.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found several uses for effects based on verlet and spring physics, even though the game lives in a world of tiles.</description>

      <description>I must really enjoy being vague.
Three reasons for this. #1, I&amp;rsquo;m an ass. #2, The art is going through a major (final) overhaul at the moment. #3, I kinda don&amp;rsquo;t want my loyal viewer to pre-judge the game yet.
So the obvious answer, yes, it&amp;rsquo;s an iPhone game. Analysis of the mosaic well tell you a few things about the game, but to my credit, it&amp;rsquo;s not a clone. It&amp;rsquo;s a few things, but not a clone.</description>

      <description>August 1st, 2005. Three years ago this Friday. I was a burned out coder that left behind his jobs as Programmer, Senior and Lead Programmer, and eventually Technical Director at various game companies. A dozen handheld, mobile, and console titles to my name. A lifetime of game fascination and experience.
Next, I was starting my own.
Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one of my former co-workers to do this, and certainly not the only one, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do it the same as we&amp;rsquo;ve done before.</description>
