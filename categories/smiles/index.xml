      <description>Progress on the tech for my upcoming game ‚ÄúAlone, The‚Äù has been a little slow the past couple weeks, due to Ludum Dare, a nightmare of server issues (both LD and my own), and my upcoming move (OMG THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT NOW). I have some great news to share though:

      <description>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I‚Äôve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I‚Äôve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù.</description>

      <description>I did miss my June 23rd target date, but with good reason: I started on computer upgrades and setting up my new Laptop early. üòÄ
But yes, as you approach the end of something, there are always things you forget about that still need to be done.
Like this, a Computer and TV-System appropriate trailer for Smiles HD (i.e. without entire screen rotating):
As you can see, that is now done.</description>

      <description>Yes, you read that right. It is ending. For real.
June 23rd is the 3 year anniversary of Smiles (as in, starting the game). I have finished every single port of the game that I had planned on doing (except console ports, both I decided to abort); Some are still in submission or need of final packaging. Days away now.
Today is June 15th, a whole week away from the anniversary.</description>

That is submitted and in the queue now. Should be available in the Amazon Kindle store soon.
BONUS!
I recorded a brief ‚Äúmaking-of‚Äù video, showing how recording the footage for the above video would look.
Now that Smiles is finally winding down, I‚Äôm hoping to do more little things like this.</description>

      <description>Hey, well that didn‚Äôt work. Smiles for WP7 after a couple weeks.
Or according to my data: 9 trial downloads, and 1 sale since. There was some twitter talking, some retweets by fellow devs, but there‚Äôs practically no noticeable spike.
Ah well, so much for that. On to bigger better things.</description>

      <description>Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my ‚ÄúMicrosoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account‚Äù yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.
I made this game (Smiles), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:
It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?</description>

A 5-star positive review of both games so far. Excellent!
I‚Äôm writing up a nice long post (to follow) about the new game. Hopefully finished soon.</description>

https://market.android.com/developer?pub=Sykhronics+Entertainment
To say the Android port has was the most requested would be an understatement. I sent messages to the list of starred people in my e-mailbox, everyone that ever asked about the Android version‚Ä¶ I hope I got everyone. It feels good to finally have this covered. Ahhh!
There are 2 versions of the game available. Content wise they‚Äôre totally the same, but the difference is as follows:</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2011/04/04/mike-and-middleware/</guid>
      <description>I‚Äôve been making games for a really long time now, but one thing I‚Äôve found myself rather resilient to was letting myself use Middleware. By Middleware, I mean 3rd party libraries. It‚Äôs funny since I always highly recommend that people use it (to save RIDICULOUS amounts of time), but I myself am just a really slow adopter of it.
SDL is one of few long-time 3rd party libraries I use. It lets me write my game code against the PC, Mac, Linux, and a few mobiles including Palm/HP‚Äôs webOS and Nokia‚Äôs Maemo.</description>

      <description>Happy April 1st!
To start, my thing to make you laugh.
I‚Äôll be finishing this up in the coming weeks. I had to prioritize some stuff ahead of it due at the end March (another reason I‚Äôve been so quiet post GDC). There was also a faux pas on my part, but nothing too big‚Ä¶ I just have to drive down to the US border and activate a 2nd gen Kindle.</description>

      <description>2011 is here! The IGF finalists have been announced, CES is upon us, and GDC is less than 2 months away. I always have a hard time following up epic posts like the last one. So with this, my third attempt (ahem), I‚Äôm going to try to be more to the point: My plans for the year.
First, the Mac App Store launches on Thursday‚Ä¶ I wonder if Mike did something for that?</description>

      <description>Added a toggle button for Windowed and Fullscreen today, and made it actually work. I also did some tweaking of the icons around the edge of the screen (pushed them higher, made the outlines more consistent).
The About/Credits screen icon is now a speech bubble (was a ‚Äú?‚Äù, so not to confuse it with the help menu). Just a few more tweaks to go before I dive in to Android.</description>

      <description>I am a regular twitter user. I run a client (twhirl) in the corner of my right monitor, so for me it works like a weird combination of an IM client and RSS reader.
A couple days ago, I caught glance of this request from Noel Llopis (developer of Flower Garden, Dr. Seuss‚Äô Lorax Garden, and the upcoming Casey‚Äôs Contraptions).
That‚Äôs a good question. As far as I know there‚Äôs no real ‚Äústandard‚Äù achievement sound (unless you want to rip-off Microsoft).</description>

      <description>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It‚Äôs been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me ‚Äî I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I‚Äôm there.</description>

      <title>Smiles in 64 bits</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2010/11/13/smiles-in-64-bits/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/11/13/smiles-in-64-bits/</guid>
      <description>So I spent the evening getting Smiles working in 64bit Linux (Ubuntu 10.10) as well as the Mac. Here are the results:
And the Mac again:
And a closeup of the processes section:
Getting it working on the Mac wasn‚Äôt really necessary, but I really like Xcode‚Äôs debugging tools. They made tracing the issue very straightforward. I had two VNC windows going almost constantly, as I‚Äôd make changes on the Workstation PC, commit to SVN, and sync on both the Mac and the Zotac.</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/11/12/ubuntu-on-the-zotac/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the meat of this post, last night I finished my ‚Äúearly‚Äù Mac App Store TODO list. I *COULD* submit it now, but there‚Äôs a bug with submissions. My iPad version is called Smiles HD, and so will be the Mac App Store version. Right now the names conflict, so I have to wait until this is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now it‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù. I sent the binary to some friends to double-check compatibility. So while I wait, it‚Äôs time to get on other ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, my Mac binary is only a 32bit Intel binary. My source &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; compile in 64bit mode, but runs in to issues. Smiles isn‚Äôt a game that needs 64bit addressing, but unlike Windows and OSX, 64bit Linux doesn‚Äôt support 32bit applications (not stock at least). So one of my next portability challenges is making my Smiles codebase support 64bit Intel and AMD chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from my Workstation PC and Macs, I have a lot of Netbooks. The Netbooks are what I usually use for Linux development. Unfortunately, all the Netbooks I currently have don‚Äôt support 64bit instructions (the current generation Intel Atom CPU‚Äôs do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ordered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zotacusa.com/zotac-mag-hd-nd01.html&#34;&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Zotac MAG&lt;/strong&gt; Nettop PC. For about $250 CAD (with a rebate), it‚Äôs a dual core Atom 330 running at 1.6 GHz, 2 GB of RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, with an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Ion&#34;&gt;NVidia ION&lt;/a&gt; chipset (GeForce 9400M). I‚Äôm technically lacking an AMD and ATI test machine, but I do have one of each elsewhere I can turn to if I run in to problems (both running Windows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version I ordered isn‚Äôt the most up to date (original NVidia ION, last year‚Äôs Dual Core Atom), which is on purpose. This is both a development and a test machine, and if I can buy one for $250, so will other people looking for a low cost PC‚Ä¶ not that an NVidia 9400M is anything to shake a stick at either. This gives me a good cross section of graphics hardware I can test in Linux (Intel GMA on the Netbooks, NVidia on the Nettop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I purchased my first Netbook a couple years back (an Acer Aspire One), I started a secondary blog where I recorded all my setup notes, thoughts, and learnings (new word!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here‚Äôs an extra little blog I created to share the super technical and super nuance details of a little project of mine. Turning a stock 8GB SSD Acer Aspire One running Linpus Linux in to an ideal lightweight coding machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything, it was a blog about me learning to use Linux for development. I know a lot more about working inside Linux now, but posts of mine like this I found extremely helpful when I started doing things like Moblin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/2008/10/intalling-console-applications.html&#34;&gt;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/2008/10/intalling-console-applications.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the remainder of this blog post will be me walking through the setup steps taken to set up this new machine for development, and get my 32bit makefile running and building code. In retrospect, the recorded setup details should be identical no matter the CPU architecture (32bit or 64bit, though this was me doing it 64bit style).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>As expected, twas the Cache</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/11/10/as-expected-twas-the-cache/</guid>
      <description>Not much to say or show, just that the performance problem was due to the textures being larger than the texture cache.
As it is now, on my Mac mini the game runs at under 8% CPU usage in the menus and Zen, and under 10% in Drop. The largest texture is 1024√ó1024, DXT5 compressed (4:1, or 1 MB). Before it was 1024√ó1024 uncompressed 32bit RGBA (1:1, or 4 MB). That either means the GMA 950 in these older Mac‚Äôs has 1 MB of cache, or perhaps 2 MB (I didn‚Äôt check with 16bit RGBA textures, but it‚Äôs unlikely).</description>

      <description>This week I‚Äôve been downloading updates for all my tools. Linux distros, as well as Apple tools and OS updates. Yesterday was spent trying to get a 64bit version of Ubuntu running on my Media Center PC (i.e. my old dual core AMD workstation PC, now hooked up to the projector). My initial attempt of installing it to a USB key didn‚Äôt work, but I did eventually get it working using WUBI.</description>

      <description>Going through my Smiles HD TODO/Wishlist, one thing I‚Äôve been meaning to add to the game for a long time was a minimize button. The game runs on several multitasking OS‚Äôs, but your only option up until now was to exit. Now, if the OS supports it, it can be suspended in to the background with just a click.</description>

      <description>Well alright. I agreed to do a little contract gig back during the summer that finally caught up with me, so the past couple weeks were spent on that. Yesterday we finally finished and submitted that, so I‚Äôm free to work on what‚Äôs really important: Smiles HD for computers!
Wait‚Ä¶ what!?
Okay, well I still do have my new-game scheduling plans detailed in the last post, but I‚Äôll be slightly delaying that start time yet again, but not by much.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs now half way through the month, and progress on my ‚ÄúOctober Game‚Äù is minimal to say the least. I suppose that was to be expected, since I did have several things to finish this month. My week-days have been filled with various tasks, leaving only weekends to work on this new thing. Next week I‚Äôll be busy with my ‚Äú1 more thing‚Äù, leaving me the last week of October for a final crunch.</description>

      <description>I quite like the aesthetics of the Zune WP7 Marketplace. It‚Äôs hard to see, but the background is this large panoramic image I whipped up. The panorama looks pretty sweet on the phone. Whomever was responsible for the Zune and WP7 phone graphic design, it‚Äôs some fine work. Hats off to you sir.</description>

      <description>Since the summer I‚Äôve been chatting with Microsoft about bringing Smiles to Windows Phone 7.
In early September, I was invited to an event ‚ÄúWindows Phone 7 Blogger Night‚Äù in Toronto.

In addition, I make a brief appearance in this video.

Here‚Äôs proof.
And here‚Äôs a snap of the game running on a completely different Windows Phone device, an LG.
I love it when code runs on many different devices. üôÇ</description>

      <title>A (rough) AppUp porting guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the items on my &lt;em&gt;seemingly infinite&lt;/em&gt; TODO list is to write an article about how to port an iPhone game to AppUp. Another item is to rework my blog layout and list all the actually useful content written here. I‚Äôve yet to do either, but I think I have here a good compromise for the 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do a-lot of emailing, and this past week I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lazy8studios.com/&#34;&gt;had a chat with a fellow developer&lt;/a&gt; who wanted some advice on porting his game. I sometimes forget about the hours of work that went in to figuring out the the right combination of Unix tools, Windows tools, cross platform libraries, and how to smash them together until they make something that actually works. So I sent him a very &lt;em&gt;to the point&lt;/em&gt; list of things that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime after that, I realized I should just post that e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I actually finished on Sunday, but the final mobile port of Smiles is now sent. The port is for Samsung‚Äôs Bada mobile platform. I was pleasantly surprised how straight forward it was to get things up and running there. The system API is very much like a C++ version of Apple‚Äôs ObjC iPhoneOS API. The whole endeavor took no more than 4 days worth of work.
So done!
I will continue to support the existing plethora of ports as needed, but now it‚Äôs time to switch gears, and get going on the new project!</description>

      <description>So finally, Smiles 1.1 for Netbooks (The Intel AppUp Center) has been submitted. Also, though Moblin Netbook Smiles was submitted last week, it came back with a very minor issue. That is now fixed, and sent as well. So Netbook Smiles == all done.
I have 1 last mobile port I‚Äôm doing, Samsung Bada. Again, Google wont let Canadians make Google Checkout Merchant accounts, so Android and NACL Smiles ports will be pending that, and a good motivator for each.</description>

      <description>The latest in the seemingly endless stream of ports (the first of the two implied quicker ports I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ though the 2nd one is sounding not so quick after all).
The N900 is a Linux (Maemo) based device, so I was literally able to pick up where I finished the Moblin (Linux) ports.
Admittedly, it was a bit of a scary port, since I was only initially able to get the game to do about 10 fps.</description>

RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I‚Äôm now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I‚Äôve been using UltraVNC on my PC‚Äôs recently, though I do run their iPhone client. üòâ
Thanks for the tip Adam.

So to make that happen, I need to power through my list of pending platforms I want to cover, before back-burner‚Äôing the rest.</description>

      <description>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I‚Äôve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!
Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‚Äòeh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).

      <description>One of the sessions I saw at GDC this year was Palm‚Äôs talk about their new PDK (i.e. their native SDK). The promise was a Linux based mobile device featuring SDL and OpenGL ES. Since my Windows and Linux code base also uses SDL and OpenGL, that certainly caught my attention. In theory, all I need to do is just recompile my Linux version with their tools and I‚Äôm done, right?</description>

      <description>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel‚Äôs AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement.</description>

      <description>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I‚Äôll talk a little more about the ‚Äúday 1 FREE‚Äù experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn‚Äôt going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device.</description>

As we speak I‚Äôm putting the finishing touches on Smiles HD, the all new higher resolution and slightly redesigned iPhone game coming soon to the iPad.
Now, in the eyes of Apple I‚Äôm nobody special. So like many of you, I‚Äôll be heading down to my local Apple store on launch day to pick me up an iPad‚Ä¶ with one slight difference.</description>

      <description>So, holy cow! GDC was absolutely insane! I almost don‚Äôt know where to start, but lets start from the beginning.
First thing first, I won again!!
Yes, as if winning a free car wasn‚Äôt enough, I also won a free trip to GDC. So Intel ended up covering my flight, putting me up in a fancy hotel, gave me some spending money, treating me to dinner, AND giving me nearly front row seats to a San Jose Sharks hockey game!</description>

      <description>Ordinarily, greeting someone by glancing at their chest might be seen as a little rude (especially a lady), but at GDC it‚Äôs encouraged! Yes I‚Äôm talking about the passes, not making a pass.
The passes do a good job of helping you connect a face to a name, and even a company, but you don‚Äôt always know who made or represents what. GDC passes include a relatively large pocket, so you could either make something to insert behind your name card, or cover the pass with some strategically placed stickers.</description>

      <description>So last year, I was an IGF Mobile finalist. This little game of mine stood alongside iPhone favorites like Edge and Fieldrunners, vying for the ‚ÄúBest Mobile Game‚Äù award. And if I had won, ‚Ä¶ well, I have no idea. Even just being a finalist has been great for me, so I‚Äôd image it would have been MORE great. üòâ
That was 2009, and this is 2010.
This year started out as my ‚Äúlow key‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù GDC.</description>

And hey, guess what?
Link here.
Second place! That‚Äôs awesome. üòÄ
So hey, what does 2nd place actually mean?
Wow. So I guess I‚Äôve got a pretty good story now when mingling at GDC. üòÄ

      <description>I‚Äôm sure this will surprise no one, but yes I‚Äôll be releasing Smiles HD for iPad.
The iPad port will be based on my current Smiles code running on Netbooks and some Windows Mobile devices (Samsung Omnia II), but I‚Äôm in the process of adding several more enhancements on top of that. I‚Äôll dive in to more of the specifics as iPad launch gets closer.
The biggest different between iPhone Smiles and my current code is I‚Äôve squared the playfield (was 9√ó8, now 8√ó8) and added rotation buttons.</description>

The store is very new and beta. It‚Äôs designed specifically for Netbooks and the OEMs that make them, but is freely available to for everyone to test and purchase from. Me personally, I had to install .NET 3.5 and .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 on my Aspire One to make it work.</description>

      <description>So wow. That‚Äôs finally it for 2009. Like doing taxes ever year, I feel a special sort of obligation that I write some sort of retrospective, especially after such an eventful year as this one. Far more awesome than taxes. üòâ
I wasn‚Äôt sure where to start, so I ended up categorizing aspects of the year. I‚Äôll free form rant about each topic as I come to it.
Let‚Äôs begin.</description>

I imagine the English versions will be available soon. Samsung‚Äôs approval department might be taking xmas off though. üòâ

      <description>Well, I can relax now. üôÇ
I have the results back from the Samsung contest, but I can‚Äôt say how that went ‚Ä¶ yet. There‚Äôs supposed to be a proper winners announcement deal on SamsungApps Thursday, so if I have anything to add, I‚Äôll do it then.
So that‚Äôs one thing off my mind.
The other thing off my mind is Intel‚Äôs contest. Netbook ports were due today, the same day as the results for Samsung.</description>

      <description>Wow. To say the last 3 weeks have been busy would be an understatement.
First of all, I ported Smiles to a new phone. The Samsung Omnia II, a Windows Mobile phone with a beautiful amoled screen and a custom GPU. Some photos.
For those keeping score, the game unfortunately runs a little slow on the Omnia II. It‚Äôs definitely playable, but the GPU is no PowerVR SGX. I did what I could in the time I had, optimized my shaders and all that, but it‚Äôs what it is.</description>

      <description>An intense month of work awaits. Crunch time, and then some!
Early/Mid last week, I spec‚Äôd out the plan for my time between now and GDC. Quite a busy schedule, with a lot of really cool things coming up. Smiles stuff, and a quick collaboration with a friend, which I‚Äôll talk more about later. I should have plenty to talk about with my internet colleagues in March.
But the icing on the cake was a development Wednesday/Thursday of last week.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a list I collected whilst getting my Smiles PC code to compile with Visual Studio 2008. Most have no equivalent in Visual Studio, but one simply has a slightly different syntax (compatible too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, long and technical. Hit the link if you‚Äôre up for the challenge. You‚Äôve been warned. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is not what I‚Äôve been up to all year, but it is what I‚Äôm up to right now.
So, let‚Äôs introduce the project.
Officially, the project is named Smiles. Specifically though, the project‚Äôs working title is Smiles PC. Just as you‚Äôd expect, it‚Äôs Smiles the iPhone game for PC, Mac and Linux. Actually it‚Äôs more than that, but lets stick with this for now.
At it‚Äôs core, Smiles PC is about removing the dependencies of the iPhone from the game.</description>

      <description>As planned, Smiles Zen 1.3 and Smiles Drop 1.3 were sent late Friday night (technically 5 AM the next day). I made the mentioned addition of arrows after discovering some people didn‚Äôt realize you could click on the icon. Here‚Äôs a snap of that from the iPhone build on the PC.
I had some friends look at this screen, and got a good reaction from the ‚Äúlove hearts‚Äù, so I made a similar change to free version.</description>

      <description>Here‚Äôs something I hope to start doing more often. Technically, I‚Äôve been hoping to actually start all year. Short development video logs.
Today‚Äôs video is a demonstration of the cross promotion features in Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop. Inspiration hit last night, and I added something amusing to it I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd share.
Both builds should go out tonight. I‚Äôll be adding a pair of arrows beside the icon, just so it‚Äôs even clearer that you can click on it right here.</description>

      <description>Smiles 1.3 is already in the Apple queue, but not Zen and Drop yet. Something ‚Äúnew‚Äù in 1.3 is that I removed the ‚Äúhow to play music‚Äù instructions from the game. This used to be in the upper right corner of the screen. The description used to say you could ‚Äúdouble tap‚Äù the home button to bring up music playback, but it seems that was wrong on the iPhones and 3rd gen iPods.</description>

      <description>Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the launch of Smiles.
‚Ä¶
Yeah, it‚Äôs been that long already.
This weekend I‚Äôm giving Smiles Zen away for FREE. Also, I‚Äôve discounting Smiles to $1.99 to reflect the price. I guess that‚Äôs how we celebrate 1 year on iPhone. üòâ
In other news, Smiles 1.3 is on the way. I discovered a graphics performance bug on the newer iPhones and iPods (SGX), so that is now fixed.</description>

      <description>The title says it all. Finally, after 10 months in the App Store, I‚Äôve decided to try out the infamous 99 cent iPhone price with Smiles.
I sent an early pre-release note to some of the iPhone press, as well as my twitter. So far it‚Äôs been picked up by Touch Arcade which is always a good place to start.
I‚Äôm hopeful. The new trailer is out there in the wild now, and-a‚Ä¶ now we wait.</description>

      <description>Yes yes, I‚Äôm awfully quiet. What else is new?
Let me tell you.
First things first, a brand new trailer for Smiles.
Why does Smiles need a new trailer? I‚Äôll tell you when you‚Äôre older.
This ended up taking a couple weeks longer than I‚Äôd hoped it would (spontaneous summer vacation?), but it‚Äôs done. The new trailer combines the tidbits dropped in the last post (mushroom animation, new logo), some gameplay footage, and a nice audio track.</description>

      <description>First on the agenda, the book is real.

As you can see above, my three complimentary copies showed up in the mail today. Word from the Dread Pirate himself (i.e. Lead Author/Tech Reviewer) is the books should be en route, if not already arriving at book stores all over the place. After all, the guy in Canada got his. üòâ

      <description>Smiles has been available for nearly 6 months in the App Store now. From the stories you may have heard, not all iPhone titles necessarily do well. But if you consider that the game was developed by one person in 4 months, it lives under the charts, and has only 1 Apple mention to it‚Äôs name, it‚Äôs actually done alright. I‚Äôm hardly ‚Äúrolling in the dough‚Äù, but I can make ends meet.</description>

      <description>Just a few hours ago I could barely move. Nearly crawling my way out of bed to attack the day (ahem‚Ä¶ night), after the long flight home.
I‚Äôve since returned to my regular routine of pacing around my studio (i.e. basement), between moments of awe e-mailing and ranting everywhere it seems appropriate (forums, twitter). As I exhausted all those wonderful forms of communication, it seemed to be right time to start the required retrospective post.</description>

      <description>Friday was the short day. Wednesday and Thursday we exhibited 10-6, where Friday was 10-3. Went back to the hotel and vegged that day, before heading back out to hang with the Fantastic Contraption guys.
My neighbors were the Secret Exit guys. I ended up spending a bulk of the show goofing off with Tuukka, an artist on Zen Bound. The Secret Exit guys refer to him as the ‚Äúprankster‚Äù of the bunch.</description>

      <description>First day of exhibiting. I have to say, I‚Äôm exhausted. Feet ached, and limped a bit throughout the day, but I loved it.
Here‚Äôs a few photos of the completed setup.

And a little closer.

I‚Äôm sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale.</description>

As you may or may not have heard, I didn‚Äôt win. But that‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôm still here to exhibit.
We‚Äôre sharing booth space with the IGF main competition entrants, which is great. That way, when people come to see the cool IGF games, they‚Äôll find us too. Here‚Äôs my slice.

Other cool stuff, Apple put up a page of us IGF Mobile entries. Very awesome.</description>

      <description>The first step with Smiles was to up the art resolution. That way, I could cleanly resize to any resolution below 4x the iPhone (1920√ó1280).
Unfortunately, double and quadruple iPhone res are not practical resolutions. Double iPhone will work windowed on most desktop LCD and 720p screens (960√ó640), and quadruple in a window fits on a 30‚Ä≥ Dell or Apple Cinema display, but we could do better.
Also, not all screens are the same shape, but the solution isn‚Äôt too difficult.</description>

      <description>Alright, I don‚Äôt see a reason not to talk about this publicly. So if I‚Äôm a good boy, I‚Äôll be walking through my process of up-scaling, converting, and porting Smiles as it happens. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to have the game available for all 3 desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Quickly, Smiles is an IGF Mobile nominated collection of puzzle games for iPhone. You can learn more about the game at smiles-game.</description>

Rebuilt the texture atlas‚Äô for the weather and vegetables tilesets, and resized the majority of the in game assets. 3x‚Äôd the iPhone res instead of 4x‚Äôd, as that would be far too huge.
Art is large enough for 1080p, but the game needs numerous changes to properly support the new aspect ratio(s).</description>

It‚Äôs also an important turning point for Smiles as a product and a brand.¬†Lets talk about that.</description>

      <description>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of Smiles, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.
To start, I‚Äôm going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year.</description>

      <title>Physics in Smiles</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2008/12/30/physics-in-smiles/</guid>
      <description>At first glance you wouldn‚Äôt think a matching game like Smiles would feature physics, but it does. In several places actually.
The most obvious example is the particle effects.
Particles were used when ice and rocks break, and also for the tile clearing effect. The tile would be erased instantly from the board, and a particle would be created in it‚Äôs place. The particle would zoom in, slow down, then zoom out with a twist.</description>

      <description>I kept video of some of my more interesting bugs/glitches/oddities in Smiles. Some more silly than others.
The first I want to show is a bug in one of the effects for the game mode Zen. It was supposed to be a ‚Äútoss a rock in to a pond‚Äù water ripple. It didn‚Äôt really work as expected.
http://www.viddler.com/explore/PoVRAZOR/videos/8/
Here‚Äôs what it was supposed to look like. Cool looking, but the problem with this was the effect would make you queasy.</description>

      <title>Smiles Drop New Years Sale, More</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2008/12/30/smiles-drop-new-years-sale-more/</guid>
      <description>Rather spontaneously, I decided to put Smiles Drop on sale for New Years.
So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab Smiles Drop for the extremely reasonable price of $1.99 (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy Smiles Zen after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on Smiles. Well‚Ä¶ you might save a penny buying separately, but still.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs been 2 weeks, and much has happened.
As the topic suggests, Smiles Drop and Smiles Zen are now both available. $2.99 each, or save $1 by getting Smiles ($4.99).
So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out. As for blog content, I‚Äôm half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days‚Ä¶ and I sorta haven‚Äôt gone back to finish the post yet.</description>

      <description>I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, ‚ÄúSmiles Drop‚Äù. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.
So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.
Wow‚Ä¶ I think I can finally take a weekend off now.</description>

      <description>Part one of my rebellion against the iPhone price drop madness has begun. Smiles Zen, the standalone version of Zen is now sent to Apple.
If everything goes according to plan, it will be released bright and early Tuesday morning. This time, I explicitly set the date.

In other news, a new review.

OSX Reality ‚Äì 4 Stars. Incredibly favorable review. Their only beef was that they expect a price drop for it to be competitive.</description>

The day started well, with the almighty Tim taking the first initiative and sharing the video.

The rest of the Think Services network picked up on the FingerGaming review as part of the usual syndication.

      <description>London, Ontario, Canada ‚Äì November 12th, 2008
Sykhronics Entertainment would like to introduce, Smiles. A brand new game now available for iPhone and iPod touch.
Smiles is a collection of 2 great games.
Smiles Drop is an unconventional action puzzle game. Unlike many others, you don‚Äôt have to wait to make your next move. In addition, you‚Äôre not pressured in to making that move either. Play at your own pace. Make matches, break ice and rocks, twisting and turning your way to higher scores.</description>

      <description>Final version of the Smiles video. It‚Äôs the short one again, but with me talking.
Here‚Äôs your chance to hear and mock Mike. I‚Äôve been getting a number of positive and amusing comments from the video. Such fun things as that I sound like an Infomercial host, and music sounds like ‚Äúcorporate training music‚Äù. Finishing this video has been an incredible hassle. Hard drives dying, frequent reboots, loss of WAV file playback in Windows, and YouTube difficulties.</description>

      <description>So I‚Äôm still working diligently to assemble my complete press package. Putting the final touches on that video, writing the press release, e-mails, all that fun stuff.
But as part of my procrastination routine, I‚Äôm hitting my usual list of sites. IndieGames, ‚ÄúThe Sauce‚Äù, etc. And as I get to the iPhone gaming sites, I‚Äôm hit with this euphoric stupor.
‚ÄúDude! That‚Äôs me!‚Äù

      <description>Just got back from the grocery store, and got the word. ‚ÄúReady for Sale‚Äú.
http://appshopper.com/games/smiles
Search for ‚ÄúSmiles‚Äù and scroll down a bit, or browse the puzzle or strategy categories in iTunes.
Contrary to the description, it‚Äôs an Action Puzzler. Lumines/Metoes ‚Äòesc, or Bejeweled on crack.
Thanks to some fancy design kung fu, it‚Äôs also what the description says. But that‚Äôs a topic all in itself.

As of 7:45 AM this Tuesday October 28th morning, the game is now sent.

Digging through my SVN logs for some stats.
Repository was created on June 22nd, 2008. That‚Äôs a total of 4 months and 6 days.
All code, art (except the original TTF font, though I did design and make the logo text), and audio created by me.</description>

      <description>Wow, it‚Äôs been so long.
The last game I did TRC for was Atomic Betty, the Gameboy Advance game I worked on before leaving Big Blue Bubble. That would have been some time during July of 2005. That finished up, and I was a free man for August 1st.
By TRC I mean Technical Requirements Checklist. Every platform holder has them, though they sometimes have a different name for them. A TRC is a combination of guidelines.</description>

Should go out to Apple on Monday afternoon. Then probably a week and it‚Äôll be live in the App Store.
I‚Äôd have taken a photo, but I‚Äôm currently cameraless.

      <description>Yikes, it‚Äôs a weekend again already! Sunday too! Ack!
Rule of thumb. When Mike says game will be out in a week or two, assume month. Then assume longer.
Ahem.
There‚Äôs always the chance that this mysterious iPhone game may destroy my ‚Äòcred‚Äô as a physics guy. Though, I‚Äôve been doing some fun stuff in it to rectify that.
I‚Äôve found several uses for effects based on verlet and spring physics, even though the game lives in a world of tiles.</description>

      <description>I must really enjoy being vague.
Three reasons for this. #1, I‚Äôm an ass. #2, The art is going through a major (final) overhaul at the moment. #3, I kinda don‚Äôt want my loyal viewer to pre-judge the game yet.
So the obvious answer, yes, it‚Äôs an iPhone game. Analysis of the mosaic well tell you a few things about the game, but to my credit, it‚Äôs not a clone. It‚Äôs a few things, but not a clone.</description>

      <description>August 1st, 2005. Three years ago this Friday. I was a burned out coder that left behind his jobs as Programmer, Senior and Lead Programmer, and eventually Technical Director at various game companies. A dozen handheld, mobile, and console titles to my name. A lifetime of game fascination and experience.
Next, I was starting my own.
Now, I‚Äôm not the only one of my former co-workers to do this, and certainly not the only one, but I didn‚Äôt want to do it the same as we‚Äôve done before.</description>
