    <h2>The final mobile port (for now)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I actually finished on Sunday, but the final mobile port of Smiles is now sent. The port is for Samsung‚Äôs Bada mobile platform. I was pleasantly surprised how straight forward it was to get things up and running there. The system API is very much like a C&#43;&#43; version of Apple‚Äôs ObjC iPhoneOS API. The whole endeavor took no more than 4 days worth of work.
So done!
I will continue to support the existing plethora of ports as needed, but now it‚Äôs time to switch gears, and get going on the new project!...</p>

    <h2>Netbook Smiles updates sent</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So finally, Smiles 1.1 for Netbooks (The Intel AppUp Center) has been submitted. Also, though Moblin Netbook Smiles was submitted last week, it came back with a very minor issue. That is now fixed, and sent as well. So Netbook Smiles == all done.
I have 1 last mobile port I‚Äôm doing, Samsung Bada. Again, Google wont let Canadians make Google Checkout Merchant accounts, so Android and NACL Smiles ports will be pending that, and a good motivator for each....</p>

    <h2>Smiles on Nokia N900 (Maemo)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The latest in the seemingly endless stream of ports (the first of the two implied quicker ports I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ though the 2nd one is sounding not so quick after all).
The N900 is a Linux (Maemo) based device, so I was literally able to pick up where I finished the Moblin (Linux) ports.
Admittedly, it was a bit of a scary port, since I was only initially able to get the game to do about 10 fps....</p>

    <p>Heh, I certainly wasn‚Äôt expecting this.
RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I‚Äôm now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I‚Äôve been using UltraVNC on my PC‚Äôs recently, though I do run their iPhone client. üòâ
Thanks for the tip Adam.

I FINALLY submitted my Moblin (Linux) AppUp port of Smiles late last night....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I have a goal of switching my focus entirely to a new project starting in July, which is about 6 weeks away. My 30th birthday is the 6th, so my folks have been joking that‚Äôll be my gift to myself. Happy Birthday Mike, you can do something else now‚Ä¶ heh.
So to make that happen, I need to power through my list of pending platforms I want to cover, before back-burner‚Äôing the rest....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I‚Äôve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!
Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‚Äòeh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).
The past week I‚Äôve been busy with a variety of things....</p>

    <h2>Smiles running on the Palm Pre, plus other things</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the sessions I saw at GDC this year was Palm‚Äôs talk about their new PDK (i.e. their native SDK). The promise was a Linux based mobile device featuring SDL and OpenGL ES. Since my Windows and Linux code base also uses SDL and OpenGL, that certainly caught my attention. In theory, all I need to do is just recompile my Linux version with their tools and I‚Äôm done, right?...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel‚Äôs AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I‚Äôll talk a little more about the ‚Äúday 1 FREE‚Äù experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn‚Äôt going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device....</p>
