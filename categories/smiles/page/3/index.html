    <h2>Ubuntu on the Zotac</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Before I get to the meat of this post, last night I finished my “early” Mac App Store TODO list. I *COULD* submit it now, but there’s a bug with submissions. My iPad version is called Smiles HD, and so will be the Mac App Store version. Right now the names conflict, so I have to wait until this is fixed.
For now it’s “done”. I sent the binary to some friends to double-check compatibility. So while I wait, it’s time to get on other ports.
Notably, my Mac binary is only a 32bit Intel binary. My source does compile in 64bit mode, but runs in to issues. Smiles isn’t a game that needs 64bit addressing, but unlike Windows and OSX, 64bit Linux doesn’t support 32bit applications (not stock at least). So one of my next portability challenges is making my Smiles codebase support 64bit Intel and AMD chips.
* * *
Aside from my Workstation PC and Macs, I have a lot of Netbooks. The Netbooks are what I usually use for Linux development. Unfortunately, all the Netbooks I currently have don’t support 64bit instructions (the current generation Intel Atom CPU’s do).
So I ordered one of these, a Zotac MAG Nettop PC. For about $250 CAD (with a rebate), it’s a dual core Atom 330 running at 1.6 GHz, 2 GB of RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, with an NVidia ION chipset (GeForce 9400M). I’m technically lacking an AMD and ATI test machine, but I do have one of each elsewhere I can turn to if I run in to problems (both running Windows).
The version I ordered isn’t the most up to date (original NVidia ION, last year’s Dual Core Atom), which is on purpose. This is both a development and a test machine, and if I can buy one for $250, so will other people looking for a low cost PC… not that an NVidia 9400M is anything to shake a stick at either. This gives me a good cross section of graphics hardware I can test in Linux (Intel GMA on the Netbooks, NVidia on the Nettop).
When I purchased my first Netbook a couple years back (an Acer Aspire One), I started a secondary blog where I recorded all my setup notes, thoughts, and learnings (new word!!).
http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/
 So here’s an extra little blog I created to share the super technical and super nuance details of a little project of mine. Turning a stock 8GB SSD Acer Aspire One running Linpus Linux in to an ideal lightweight coding machine.
 More than anything, it was a blog about me learning to use Linux for development. I know a lot more about working inside Linux now, but posts of mine like this I found extremely helpful when I started doing things like Moblin:
http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/2008/10/intalling-console-applications.html
So the remainder of this blog post will be me walking through the setup steps taken to set up this new machine for development, and get my 32bit makefile running and building code. In retrospect, the recorded setup details should be identical no matter the CPU architecture (32bit or 64bit, though this was me doing it 64bit style).

    <h2>As expected, twas the Cache</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Not much to say or show, just that the performance problem was due to the textures being larger than the texture cache.
As it is now, on my Mac mini the game runs at under 8% CPU usage in the menus and Zen, and under 10% in Drop. The largest texture is 1024×1024, DXT5 compressed (4:1, or 1 MB). Before it was 1024×1024 uncompressed 32bit RGBA (1:1, or 4 MB). That either means the GMA 950 in these older Mac’s has 1 MB of cache, or perhaps 2 MB (I didn’t check with 16bit RGBA textures, but it’s unlikely)....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This week I’ve been downloading updates for all my tools. Linux distros, as well as Apple tools and OS updates. Yesterday was spent trying to get a 64bit version of Ubuntu running on my Media Center PC (i.e. my old dual core AMD workstation PC, now hooked up to the projector). My initial attempt of installing it to a USB key didn’t work, but I did eventually get it working using WUBI....</p>

    <h2>Minimize and Exit buttons in a screen layout</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Going through my Smiles HD TODO/Wishlist, one thing I’ve been meaning to add to the game for a long time was a minimize button. The game runs on several multitasking OS’s, but your only option up until now was to exit. Now, if the OS supports it, it can be suspended in to the background with just a click....</p>

    <h2>Smiles for PC&amp;#8217;s, Mac&amp;#8217;s and Linux&amp;#8217;s Month (and Droids?)</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Well alright. I agreed to do a little contract gig back during the summer that finally caught up with me, so the past couple weeks were spent on that. Yesterday we finally finished and submitted that, so I’m free to work on what’s really important: Smiles HD for computers!
Wait… what!?
Okay, well I still do have my new-game scheduling plans detailed in the last post, but I’ll be slightly delaying that start time yet again, but not by much....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>It’s now half way through the month, and progress on my “October Game” is minimal to say the least. I suppose that was to be expected, since I did have several things to finish this month. My week-days have been filled with various tasks, leaving only weekends to work on this new thing. Next week I’ll be busy with my “1 more thing”, leaving me the last week of October for a final crunch....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I quite like the aesthetics of the Zune WP7 Marketplace. It’s hard to see, but the background is this large panoramic image I whipped up. The panorama looks pretty sweet on the phone. Whomever was responsible for the Zune and WP7 phone graphic design, it’s some fine work. Hats off to you sir....</p>

    <h2>Smiles for WP7, the PR so far</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Since the summer I’ve been chatting with Microsoft about bringing Smiles to Windows Phone 7.
In early September, I was invited to an event “Windows Phone 7 Blogger Night” in Toronto.

In addition, I make a brief appearance in this video.

Heh, this might be one of my worst appearances on video (Mr. Shiny forehead), but fortunately it’s very quick....</p>

    <p>So here’s that news: Smiles is coming to Windows Phone 7!
Here’s proof.
And here’s a snap of the game running on a completely different Windows Phone device, an LG.
I love it when code runs on many different devices. 🙂...</p>

    <h2>A (rough) AppUp porting guide</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the items on my seemingly infinite TODO list is to write an article about how to port an iPhone game to AppUp. Another item is to rework my blog layout and list all the actually useful content written here. I’ve yet to do either, but I think I have here a good compromise for the 1st.
I do a-lot of emailing, and this past week I had a chat with a fellow developer who wanted some advice on porting his game. I sometimes forget about the hours of work that went in to figuring out the the right combination of Unix tools, Windows tools, cross platform libraries, and how to smash them together until they make something that actually works. So I sent him a very to the point list of things that I do.
Sometime after that, I realized I should just post that e-mail.
