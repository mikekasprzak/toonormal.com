    <h2>Final cross promotion and freebie changes</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>As planned, Smiles Zen 1.3 and Smiles Drop 1.3 were sent late Friday night (technically 5 AM the next day). I made the mentioned addition of arrows after discovering some people didn‚Äôt realize you could click on the icon. Here‚Äôs a snap of that from the iPhone build on the PC.
I had some friends look at this screen, and got a good reaction from the ‚Äúlove hearts‚Äù, so I made a similar change to free version....</p>

    <h2>Video: Cross promotion in Smiles</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Here‚Äôs something I hope to start doing more often. Technically, I‚Äôve been hoping to actually start all year. Short development video logs.
Today‚Äôs video is a demonstration of the cross promotion features in Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop. Inspiration hit last night, and I added something amusing to it I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd share.
Both builds should go out tonight. I‚Äôll be adding a pair of arrows beside the icon, just so it‚Äôs even clearer that you can click on it right here....</p>

    <h2>Cross promotion in Zen and Drop</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Smiles 1.3 is already in the Apple queue, but not Zen and Drop yet. Something ‚Äúnew‚Äù in 1.3 is that I removed the ‚Äúhow to play music‚Äù instructions from the game. This used to be in the upper right corner of the screen. The description used to say you could ‚Äúdouble tap‚Äù the home button to bring up music playback, but it seems that was wrong on the iPhones and 3rd gen iPods....</p>

    <h2>Smiles 1 Year Anniversary</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the launch of Smiles.
‚Ä¶
Yeah, it‚Äôs been that long already.
This weekend I‚Äôm giving Smiles Zen away for FREE. Also, I‚Äôve discounting Smiles to $1.99 to reflect the price. I guess that‚Äôs how we celebrate 1 year on iPhone. üòâ
In other news, Smiles 1.3 is on the way. I discovered a graphics performance bug on the newer iPhones and iPods (SGX), so that is now fixed....</p>

    <h2>Smiles on sale for 99 cents</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The title says it all. Finally, after 10 months in the App Store, I‚Äôve decided to try out the infamous 99 cent iPhone price with Smiles.
I sent an early pre-release note to some of the iPhone press, as well as my twitter. So far it‚Äôs been picked up by Touch Arcade which is always a good place to start.
I‚Äôm hopeful. The new trailer is out there in the wild now, and-a‚Ä¶ now we wait....</p>

    <p>Yes yes, I‚Äôm awfully quiet. What else is new?
Let me tell you.
First things first, a brand new trailer for Smiles.
Why does Smiles need a new trailer? I‚Äôll tell you when you‚Äôre older.
This ended up taking a couple weeks longer than I‚Äôd hoped it would (spontaneous summer vacation?), but it‚Äôs done. The new trailer combines the tidbits dropped in the last post (mushroom animation, new logo), some gameplay footage, and a nice audio track....</p>

    <p>Been caught up with a number of things. Here‚Äôs one I‚Äôm rather proud of, an animated Smiles mushroom animation.
Click for 400k animated gif
Animated in ToonBoom Studio.
Something else, an updated Sykhronics Logo animation.
That one is me goofing off in Sony Vegas.
Fun fun....</p>

    <p>First on the agenda, the book is real.

As you can see above, my three complimentary copies showed up in the mail today. Word from the Dread Pirate himself (i.e. Lead Author/Tech Reviewer) is the books should be en route, if not already arriving at book stores all over the place. After all, the guy in Canada got his. üòâ

    <h2>The shelf-life of Smiles</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Smiles has been available for nearly 6 months in the App Store now. From the stories you may have heard, not all iPhone titles necessarily do well. But if you consider that the game was developed by one person in 4 months, it lives under the charts, and has only 1 Apple mention to it‚Äôs name, it‚Äôs actually done alright. I‚Äôm hardly ‚Äúrolling in the dough‚Äù, but I can make ends meet....</p>
