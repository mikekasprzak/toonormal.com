    <p>Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my “Microsoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account” yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.
I made this game (Smiles), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:
It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?...</p>

    <p>Looks like the Symbian^3 versions of the game went live this morning in the Ovi store.
A 5-star positive review of both games so far. Excellent!
I’m writing up a nice long post (to follow) about the new game. Hopefully finished soon....</p>

To say the Android port has was the most requested would be an understatement. I sent messages to the list of starred people in my e-mailbox, everyone that ever asked about the Android version… I hope I got everyone. It feels good to finally have this covered. Ahhh!
There are 2 versions of the game available. Content wise they’re totally the same, but the difference is as follows:...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve been making games for a really long time now, but one thing I’ve found myself rather resilient to was letting myself use Middleware. By Middleware, I mean 3rd party libraries. It’s funny since I always highly recommend that people use it (to save RIDICULOUS amounts of time), but I myself am just a really slow adopter of it.
SDL is one of few long-time 3rd party libraries I use. It lets me write my game code against the PC, Mac, Linux, and a few mobiles including Palm/HP’s webOS and Nokia’s Maemo....</p>

    <p>Happy April 1st!
To start, my thing to make you laugh.
I’ll be finishing this up in the coming weeks. I had to prioritize some stuff ahead of it due at the end March (another reason I’ve been so quiet post GDC). There was also a faux pas on my part, but nothing too big… I just have to drive down to the US border and activate a 2nd gen Kindle....</p>

    <p>2011 is here! The IGF finalists have been announced, CES is upon us, and GDC is less than 2 months away. I always have a hard time following up epic posts like the last one. So with this, my third attempt (ahem), I’m going to try to be more to the point: My plans for the year.
First, the Mac App Store launches on Thursday… I wonder if Mike did something for that?...</p>

    <p>Added a toggle button for Windowed and Fullscreen today, and made it actually work. I also did some tweaking of the icons around the edge of the screen (pushed them higher, made the outlines more consistent).
The About/Credits screen icon is now a speech bubble (was a “?”, so not to confuse it with the help menu). Just a few more tweaks to go before I dive in to Android....</p>

    <p>I am a regular twitter user. I run a client (twhirl) in the corner of my right monitor, so for me it works like a weird combination of an IM client and RSS reader.
A couple days ago, I caught glance of this request from Noel Llopis (developer of Flower Garden, Dr. Seuss’ Lorax Garden, and the upcoming Casey’s Contraptions).
That’s a good question. As far as I know there’s no real “standard” achievement sound (unless you want to rip-off Microsoft)....</p>

    <p>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It’s been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me — I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I’m there....</p>

    <p>So I spent the evening getting Smiles working in 64bit Linux (Ubuntu 10.10) as well as the Mac. Here are the results:
And the Mac again:
And a closeup of the processes section:
Getting it working on the Mac wasn’t really necessary, but I really like Xcode’s debugging tools. They made tracing the issue very straightforward. I had two VNC windows going almost constantly, as I’d make changes on the Workstation PC, commit to SVN, and sync on both the Mac and the Zotac....</p>
