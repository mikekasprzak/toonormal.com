    <h2>Introducing: The Indie Indie Conversation</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I‚Äôve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I‚Äôve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù....</p>

    <h2>The last Smiles Trailer</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I did miss my June 23rd target date, but with good reason: I started on computer upgrades and setting up my new Laptop early. üòÄ
But yes, as you approach the end of something, there are always things you forget about that still need to be done.
Like this, a Computer and TV-System appropriate trailer for Smiles HD (i.e. without entire screen rotating):
As you can see, that is now done....</p>

    <h2>Ending Smiles</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yes, you read that right. It is ending. For real.
June 23rd is the 3 year anniversary of Smiles (as in, starting the game). I have finished every single port of the game that I had planned on doing (except console ports, both I decided to abort); Some are still in submission or need of final packaging. Days away now.
Today is June 15th, a whole week away from the anniversary....</p>

    <p>Speaking of better, here‚Äôs the final gameplay trailer for Kindle Smiles:
That is submitted and in the queue now. Should be available in the Amazon Kindle store soon.
BONUS!
I recorded a brief ‚Äúmaking-of‚Äù video, showing how recording the footage for the above video would look.
Now that Smiles is finally winding down, I‚Äôm hoping to do more little things like this....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Hey, well that didn‚Äôt work. Smiles for WP7 after a couple weeks.
Or according to my data: 9 trial downloads, and 1 sale since. There was some twitter talking, some retweets by fellow devs, but there‚Äôs practically no noticeable spike.
Ah well, so much for that. On to bigger better things....</p>
