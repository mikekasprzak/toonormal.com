      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something different.
Been working on the HTML5 side of my library code, and I kinda made this little demo for fun. Music is Garth Knight&amp;rsquo;s track Activate the Cage.
Ludum Dare 30 is this weekend. Hoo boy! Running that crazyfest is keeping me sooo busy. üôÇ</description>

      <description>An intense month of work awaits. Crunch time, and then some!
Early/Mid last week, I spec&amp;rsquo;d out the plan for my time between now and GDC. Quite a busy schedule, with a lot of really cool things coming up. Smiles stuff, and a quick collaboration with a friend, which I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about later. I should have plenty to talk about with my internet colleagues in March.
But the icing on the cake was a development Wednesday/Thursday of last week.</description>

      <description>I hate ‚ÄúI&amp;rsquo;m still here‚Äù posts, but I still feel I owe something. Blame thinking too much, and being busy. I do.</description>

      <description>Oh boy!
Nothing significant, I just forgot how amusing some of this stuff can be. Taken from 1950&amp;rsquo;s PSA called ‚ÄúDuck and Cover‚Äú, via Archive.org.
Then I started playing with clips from the PSA.
Have a good day.</description>

      <description>Nothing says ‚Äúmanly‚Äù like Pine walls, big ass pro-audio ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù speakers, a forklift and space robot having a debate, and a bright pink Kleenex box.
Clearly, the speakers are the offending item.</description>

      <description>A heinous plot unfolded recently to clearly steal our source code, and perhaps our munchies.
Fortunately, the culprit was thwarted by the window.</description>

      <description>You think you&amp;rsquo;re clever, defacing a name-tag using a post it note, and waltzing around the workspace a few days before Halloween. Then someone defaces your name-tag whilst you&amp;rsquo;re away.
The legend lives on.</description>
