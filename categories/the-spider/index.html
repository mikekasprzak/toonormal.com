    <h1 class="post-title">The Development of Smiles, Part 0</h1>
    <div class="post-meta">Mike K ¬∑ January 2, 2009
    </div>
  </header>
  <div class="post-content"><p>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of <strong>Smiles</strong>, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.</p>
<p>To start, I‚Äôm going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my <a href="/2008/03/01/engines-names-and-evolution-part-1/"><strong>Engines</strong></a>, <a href="/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-2/"><strong>Names</strong></a> <strong>and</strong> <a href="/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-3/"><strong>Evolution</strong></a> blog series last year.</p>
<p>I apologize, but I <em>am</em> going to skip a significant follow up to that series for now (the <strong>Hammer</strong> engine), but this series should bring us back up to date.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>Late 2007 and early 2008 were spent working on libraries, and foundation for my new engine <strong>Playground</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Playground</strong> was the successor to <strong>Hammer</strong> (<strong>PuffBOMB HD</strong>‚Ä¶ will talk about this another day), which in turn succeeded <a href="/2008/03/04/engines-names-and-evolution-part-3/"><strong>Freedom</strong></a>.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>Before <strong>PuffBOMB HD</strong> was shelved in late 2007 (<strong>Hammer</strong> engine), I was working alone on the project. Amicably, but that‚Äôs a series for another day.</p>
<p>The core issue with <strong>Hammer</strong> is that it wasn‚Äôt very reusable. As a whole, you could certainly build a new project based on it, but it‚Äôs elements were poorly isolated. Triangulation and collision testing code was embedded right in to the physics engine, so I couldn‚Äôt use the same code elsewhere without a lot of waste.</p>
<p>I prototype games regularly, and the product of this year of development (2007) wasn‚Äôt as useful as it could be.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>Late 2007, I was at a crossroads. I still had savings left, but only enough to support myself. I needed a break from <strong>PuffBOMB HD</strong>, so I coined a new project. A suite of libraries and tools I could personally use for prototyping and developing games faster and more efficiently. The end goal may have been to build a Metroidvania derivative, but the core of the project was to build me some tools. If the project was going to fail again, at least I‚Äôd have a foundation to try the next thing. This was the <strong>Playground</strong> project.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs where I get technical.</p>
<p>As mentioned, <strong>Playground</strong> is a suite of libraries and tools. It started with me collecting what usable parts I could extract from <strong>Hammer</strong>, and my Ludum Dare games and framework.</p>
<p>I should also mention that by library I‚Äôm referring to an element. A directory of files. Either copy the directory in to a project, or set up an SVN External for it. Only a crazy person would compile their work in progress library to a .lib/.a file and install it. If that‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre crazy! üôÇ</p>
<p>One of the first and most useful elements I built was the <em>Data and Serialization</em> library. I decided to finally stop using C++ streams for binary File I/O, but wanted my file reading syntax to be nicer than fopen. The syntax for loading an arbitrary binary file from disk is as follows.</p>
<p><strong>DataBlock</strong>* MyData **=** _new_DataBlock_( ‚ÄúData.bin‚Äù );</p>
<p>Nice and easy. A <strong>DataBlock</strong> is an incredibly useful and lightweight basic type. It represents an arbitrary block of memory with a size stored in the first 4 bytes. It‚Äôs defined as followed.</p>
<p><code>&lt;strong&gt;struct&lt;/strong&gt; DataBlock {&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;size_t&lt;/strong&gt; Size;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;char&lt;/strong&gt; Data[0];&lt;br /&gt; };</code></p>
<p>Pretty simple. For completion, the <em>Data and Serialization</em> library includes similar calls for normal non <strong>DataBlock</strong> data, but they‚Äôre so lightweight and flexible I use them anyways.</p>
<p>The great part about writing your own I/O wrapper is you can seamlessly integrate things like compression, munging, CRC‚Äôs and checksums. For example, load and decompress a file in 3 lines (one cleanup).</p>
<p><strong>DataBlock</strong>* Compressed **=** _new_DataBlock_( ‚ÄúCompressedFile.zlib‚Äù );</p>
<p><strong>DataBlock</strong>* Uncompressed **=** _unpack_ZLIB_DataBlock_( Compressed );</p>
<p><em>delete_DataBlock</em>( Compressed );</p>
<p>The library is also written in such a way that, while it supports many compressors/hash methods, they are not required to be built or linked against the project unless explicitly used. In other words, if I don‚Äôt use BZIP2, I don‚Äôt need the BZIP2 headers or C files. As lightweight as you can make a library.</p>
<p>The <em>vector math</em> library is borrowed right from <strong>Hammer</strong>, cleaned up and isolated to be vector, scalar, and matrix math only. Types for rectangles and simple primitives are a library. Coding niceties like template types containing a,b,c or r,g,b,a components are a library. Strings, parsing a whitespace delimited file, and debug console logging as well.</p>
<p>Collision tests, and everything you do between primitives is a library of functions. Extremely long names, but they‚Äôre now modular in such a way they can be used in a physics engine, in a primitives library or a GUI/Menu system.</p>
<p><code>&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; ( Test_Point_Vs_Polygon2D( ... ) ) ...</code></p>
<p>Where this one returns a boolean value. I wont bother listing the arguments, but it‚Äôs a global C-like function. It takes direct types and pointers where appropriate. The functions follow the form ‚ÄúAction_What_Relationship_Who( ‚Ä¶ );‚Äù. <em>Action</em> is the operation, <em>What</em> and <em>Who</em> are the terms being tested, and the <em>Relationship</em> is the rest of grammar required to describe the operation.</p>
<p><code>Nearest_Point_On_Chain2D( ... );&lt;br /&gt; Nearest_CornerPoint_OnEdgeOf_Polygon3D( ... );</code></p>
<p>Where the <strong>Smiles</strong> story begins is the <strong>Grid</strong> library.</p>
<p><strong>Grid</strong> was a library created for a Ludum Dare game <strong>Pillar Caterpillar</strong>.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs some concept art.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Pillar Caterpillar</strong> wasn‚Äôt playable within the compo timeline. It however still featured some great pre-production work, and a useful chunk of code that became it‚Äôs own library in <strong>Playground</strong>. Further work was done on the project, but that mock-up is the coolest looking part.</p>
<p>For the time being, only minor changes were done to <strong>Grid</strong>.</p>
<p>‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì</p>
<p>Shortly after the iPhone SDK was official announced in March 2008, I started prototyping some game concepts. The first, <strong>Magtraction</strong> (since Magnetica was taken, by a game completely unrelated to magnets).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A prototyped game concept deemed ‚Äú<strong>too boring</strong>‚Äú.</p>
<p>The second, <strong>Dungeon Legion</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A prototype game concept deemed ‚Äú<strong>too awesome</strong>‚Äú. Too awesome to finish in a short period of time. üòÄ</p>
<p>Both of these prototypes were the projects used to get the geometry tests up and working again.</p>
<p>You might hear more about <strong>Pillar Caterpillar</strong> and/or <strong>Dungeon Legion</strong> in the coming months (both projects are on my list I‚Äôm considering).</p>
<p>For the 3rd prototype, I wanted to revisit <strong>Grid</strong>.</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Ballistic Force wasn‚Äôt a long project, but development was dense.
Early on, I attempted a poorly conceived idea of creating densely constructed particle landscape. I wanted a system sort of like molecular/planetary attraction to keep scenery together, and allow clumping like a cartoon snowball rolling down a hill. It might have worked on something highly parallel like a GPU or the PS3‚Äôs SPE‚Äôs, but my design really wasn‚Äôt well thought out....</p>

    <p>This next engines name and story is a little complicated.
Game development became a constant burn out for me. Since finishing Secret Agent Barbie (Gameboy Advance) and Polly Pocket (Gameboy Advance), it became clear to me the only thing keeping me going was my fascination with new platforms. Certainly not the subject matter.
After we finished Polly Pocket, I asked for a month off to deal with my burn out. However, we quickly picked up a new game, Barbie: Gotta Have Games (Playstation)....</p>

    <p>Yeah, sorry. I wanted to do detailed commentary of The Spider stuffs, the in between stuff, and get in to the new PuffBOMB stuff, but it looks like it didn‚Äôt happen. I wrote an outline and drafted a couple parts, but I wasn‚Äôt happy with the results.

    <p>Before starting work on ‚ÄúThe Spider‚Äù, I was building the engine for the ‚Äúnew PuffBOMB‚Äù. The concept behind the engine, 2D characters and physics, 3D backgrounds styled to look 2D, HD ready. Pretty standard stuff.
The concept behind ‚ÄúThe Spider‚Äù is, unlike a normal platformer where you stand on the ground, this one you wouldn‚Äôt. Instead you would hang from and move along ceilings. The best idea I had at the time for pulling it off was something I nicknamed ‚Äúdouble ropes‚Äù, one to support, and one for action....</p>
