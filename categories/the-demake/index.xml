      <description>Uh&amp;hellip; I am concerned about what that potion would do to me if I drank it. (a typo/bug from today, hehe)
Hello! This is quite possibly the last post I&amp;rsquo;ll do in 2011, so lets make with the goods!
This past week I&amp;rsquo;ve continued working on the demake of my primary project. If you checked out the Ludum Dare prototype, the core mechanics have dramatically improved since then (about 4 days ago).</description>

      <description>I wont talk too much about how Ludum Dare itself went, as I&amp;rsquo;ve already done that over here.
But in addition to running the event, I participated for the first time in a long time. The theme was â€œAloneâ€œ, which I find funny given the title of my game. Could I not enter? ðŸ˜‰
About a week before Ludum Dare, I started toying with the idea of creating a demake of my game.</description>
