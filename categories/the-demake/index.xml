      <description>Hello! This is quite possibly the last post Iâ€™ll do in 2011, so lets make with the goods!
This past week Iâ€™ve continued working on the demake of my primary project. If you checked out the Ludum Dare prototype, the core mechanics have dramatically improved since then (about 4 days ago).
I actually keep a relatively detailed development Journal while working, but a lot of stuff is either very minor, subtle, contains spoilers, or is simply just too long to post.</description>

      <description>I wont talk too much about how Ludum Dare itself went, as Iâ€™ve already done that over here.
But in addition to running the event, I participated for the first time in a long time. The theme was â€œAloneâ€œ, which I find funny given the title of my game. Could I not enter? ðŸ˜‰
About a week before Ludum Dare, I started toying with the idea of creating a demake of my game.</description>
