      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making games for a really long time now, but one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself rather resilient to was letting myself use Middleware. By Middleware, I mean 3rd party libraries. It&amp;rsquo;s funny since I always highly recommend that people use it (to save RIDICULOUS amounts of time), but I myself am just a really slow adopter of it.
SDL is one of few long-time 3rd party libraries I use. It lets me write my game code against the PC, Mac, Linux, and a few mobiles including Palm/HP&amp;rsquo;s webOS and Nokia&amp;rsquo;s Maemo.</description>

      <description>2011 is here! The IGF finalists have been announced, CES is upon us, and GDC is less than 2 months away. I always have a hard time following up epic posts like the last one. So with this, my third attempt (ahem), I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to be more to the point: My plans for the year.
First, the Mac App Store launches on Thursday&amp;hellip; I wonder if Mike did something for that?</description>

      <description>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of Smiles, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.
To start, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year.</description>
