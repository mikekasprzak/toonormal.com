      <title>I am retiring from Indie Game Dev</title>

      <description>It‚Äôs true. After 10 years, I‚Äôll be wrapping up my games business. Later this year, I‚Äôll be moving on to other things.
I am still going to be around. I‚Äôd still like to attend GDC in San Francisco every year. Ludum Dare is a thing I‚Äôll continue to work on and run (and if I‚Äôm lucky, I might be able to enter again some day). I‚Äôm also going to continue doing little projects that amuse me, things like my Commodore 64 game from New Years.</description>

      <description>The following is some rambling. I have a point I‚Äôm trying to make, but I‚Äôm certain I don‚Äôt make it. My fingers kept moving, and this is what resulted. You can kinda get an idea what sort of madness is bouncing around in the ‚Äòol noodle right now though. Good luck.
 *Big Sigh*
I‚Äôm typically a ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù, ‚Äúnative code is best‚Äù, ‚Äúc++ FTW‚Äù type of developer. The thing is, developers with my skillset and experience really are at a big disadvantage in today‚Äôs game market.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I began a process of rebranding my company. Shortly after leaving my AAA job in 2005, I created this logo.

Thing is, that‚Äôs not even one of the better logos I used, it‚Äôs just the most business‚Äôy one.
More here.
As you can see, I used to be really in to playing with typography. Sykhronics is a name I‚Äôve been using for the past 15 years. In the early days, it was my portfolio website.</description>

      <description>Enough of this non-game talk.
The past month has been extremely good for progress. I did not meet my goal for the month, but I‚Äôd be silly to complain. Yadda yadda ya.
Against my better judgement, I‚Äôm going to stop beating around the bush and show you:
 That‚Äôs cool Mike, but what is it?
 Tech.
 Wait Mike, you could have done that in a day using Unity? It would be faster!</description>

      <title>The Synology NAS, two months later</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2011/10/29/the-synology-nas-two-months-later/</link>

      <description>NAS time, again! Like before, I‚Äôm collecting my notes and thoughts all in one place.
Two months later As mentioned in my earlier posts, I‚Äôm running both SVN and AppDailySales on it (iTunes Connect Sales Stat grabber). In addition, I‚Äôve been running an internal wiki on it. I used to host 2 different external wikis, but both have been imported and archived locally.
I chose DokuWiki for my internal wiki because it uses flat files, meaning I don‚Äôt have to run SQL (though it is just a button to enable MySQL on the Synology).</description>

      <description>Progress on the tech for my upcoming game ‚ÄúAlone, The‚Äù has been a little slow the past couple weeks, due to Ludum Dare, a nightmare of server issues (both LD and my own), and my upcoming move (OMG THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT NOW). I have some great news to share though:

      <title>AppDailySales, and running on Synology NAS Devices</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2011/08/23/appdailysales-and-running-on-synology-nas-devices/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2011 23:59:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://new.toonormal.com/2011/08/23/appdailysales-and-running-on-synology-nas-devices/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/002.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Continuing &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2011/08/23/i-am-running-a-synology-nas-now/&#34;&gt;my prior post&lt;/a&gt; where I talk about my server replacement, a Synology NAS (DS211j). In essence, a cheap, tiny dedicated Linux box featuring an ARM CPU and custom web UI specially designed for SUPER EASY RAID array maintenance and creation. There‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS411j&amp;amp;lang=enu&#34;&gt;a 4 drive version&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/index.php?lang=enu&#34;&gt;many-more drive&lt;/a&gt; versions, but they cost more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I‚Äôm here to talk about a little tool for getting your daily sales data from Apple‚Äôs iTunes Connect website. &lt;strong&gt;AppDailySales&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/&#34;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a python script I was recommended some months back, but it needed a few things IMO. So in a shocking rare case of OSS justice, I added the features I wanted myself and submitted a patch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/issues/detail?id=31&amp;amp;can=1&#34;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/issues/detail?id=31&amp;amp;can=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago (nine months later), version 2.9 was released (sparked by Apple‚Äôs change to the system), now including my patches! üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the script, all you need is Python. Before I used to run this on Windows XP (Python installed in C:\Python2.7, with PATH environment variable set to include this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the NAS, I SSH in to the device (Go download Putty if on Windows), login as root (same password as admin), and install the python package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ipkg install python&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the AppDailySales.py script somewhere on your computer, likely in the same folder you want your stats placed. Then simply invoke it with ‚Äìhelp to get a list of arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python appdailysales.py --help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run it from a batch file or script. My old Batch File Version looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new, shockingly similar shell script version (i.e. only single %‚Äôs) is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates files like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-13.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-12.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-11.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-10.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice and easy to read names, unlike the default files generated by iTunes Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next section, I‚Äôll talk more about setting it up as a service. In other words, totally automated!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2006/10/07/new-server-aka-i-killed-a-cisco/&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last week, a drive &lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/2006/10/07/new-server-aka-i-killed-a-cisco/&#34;&gt;in my server died&lt;/a&gt;. These drives weren‚Äôt really that old, but were Seagate‚Äôs from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1050374/seagate-barracuda-7200-drives-failing&#34;&gt;drive failing epidemic&lt;/a&gt; a few years back. I bought 6 drives around this time, 4 for the server in a RAID 10 array, 2 for my workstation. I lost 1 to the failure problem, and the rest I managed to get updated firmwares installed in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have been extremely leery of Seagate drives. My server ran Windows XP (yes), and used the on-board Intel SATA RAID controller of this MOBO. On several occasions, the RAID integrity would fail for no good reason upon bootup, that I simply stopped turning my server off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother the ‚Äúprofessional network admin‚Äù has been reminding me for years that Software Linux RAID is the best RAID. So after this tragic failure (no data lost, just some hair), it was time for something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I have been talking NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices for a while, he himself trying a few over the years, to really sub-par results. Generally, the prices were terrible for completely sub par hardware that couldn‚Äôt perform. Popular NAS like the Drobo start at like $700, yuck! The best bang for buck always seemed to be building a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, bang for buck wise, building your own file server is still cheaper. But Linux is a delicate mistress. I am a coder, and dealing with game console development tools and Linux setups over the years has taught me how to live comfortably in Linux. I work on Windows though, just I do it with Cygwin and MinGW/MSys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, there is still too much sh*t to learn about Linux. Time is money. Building and maintaining another server, I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt want to do it (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freenas.org/&#34;&gt;FreeNAS&lt;/a&gt; was suggested on my Twitter, for anyone in a more adventurous mood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs 2011, give me a drop in solution that‚Äôs cheap, small, fast and good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_20110823_214643.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blam!&lt;/strong&gt; Hello &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS211j&amp;amp;lang=enu&#34;&gt;Synology DS211j&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 2 drive consumer model rakes in at around $200, size not much larger than an eternal casing, and sporting a 1.2 GHz ARM processor. ARM! Hey! I know those!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs a breed of Linux, interfaces via gorgeous fast HTML UI, and support fancy Linux favorites like SSH out-of-the-box. Well not quite out-of-the-box, as you do need to download the latest firmware and a setup tool for your OS, but that‚Äôs easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine I filed with a pair of 3TB Hitachi Deskstar drives, spinning at 7200 RPMS with 64 MB of cache. Western Digital Caviar Green drives were $40 cheaper each, but are known to be slow and problematic on RAIDs (though there are fixes, a tool WDidle3 seems to address this). Again, time is da mon-nay, and wanted something I could just drop in. Benchmarks said these drives were better overall performers too, so hey, why not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://new.toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/002.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hardware setup was a matter of unboxing, opening it (sliding case sides front and back to unlock), plugging my drives in, screwing them in, and closing the casing (opposite of opening). I think I had this done in 5 minutes, max. Didn‚Äôt even need a manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the array I wanted (MODE 1) was extremely straightforward, that I wont both talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I will talk about is some of the advanced stuff I wanted from it, and the configuring done to make it act accordingly. After all, this blog post is actually for me, so I can know what I did in case I need to reproduce it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures.</description>

      <description>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I‚Äôve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I‚Äôve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù.</description>

      <description>Yes, you read that right. It is ending. For real.
June 23rd is the 3 year anniversary of Smiles (as in, starting the game). I have finished every single port of the game that I had planned on doing (except console ports, both I decided to abort); Some are still in submission or need of final packaging. Days away now.
Today is June 15th, a whole week away from the anniversary.</description>

      <description>Hey, well that didn‚Äôt work. Smiles for WP7 after a couple weeks.
Or according to my data: 9 trial downloads, and 1 sale since. There was some twitter talking, some retweets by fellow devs, but there‚Äôs practically no noticeable spike.
Ah well, so much for that. On to bigger better things.</description>

      <description>Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my ‚ÄúMicrosoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account‚Äù yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.
I made this game (Smiles), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:
It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?</description>

      <description>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It‚Äôs been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me ‚Äî I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I‚Äôm there.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, I was inspired to start playing with logo designs. There‚Äôs no new decisions to be seen here in this post, just some ideas I‚Äôm playing with (and rejecting).
I actually used to make my own typography and font designs, one such example is this:
You can see more examples of prior logos here.
For the past 5 years I‚Äôve been using this:

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever really liked it, but it was good enough.</description>

      <description>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel‚Äôs AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement.</description>

      <description>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I‚Äôll talk a little more about the ‚Äúday 1 FREE‚Äù experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn‚Äôt going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device.</description>

      <description>Alright! The iPad is coming soon, as is a brand new version of Smiles.
As we speak I‚Äôm putting the finishing touches on Smiles HD, the all new higher resolution and slightly redesigned iPhone game coming soon to the iPad.
Now, in the eyes of Apple I‚Äôm nobody special. So like many of you, I‚Äôll be heading down to my local Apple store on launch day to pick me up an iPad‚Ä¶ with one slight difference.</description>

Animated in ToonBoom Studio.
Something else, an updated Sykhronics Logo animation.
That one is me goofing off in Sony Vegas.

      <description>Smiles has been available for nearly 6 months in the App Store now. From the stories you may have heard, not all iPhone titles necessarily do well. But if you consider that the game was developed by one person in 4 months, it lives under the charts, and has only 1 Apple mention to it‚Äôs name, it‚Äôs actually done alright. I‚Äôm hardly ‚Äúrolling in the dough‚Äù, but I can make ends meet.</description>

      <description>Just a few hours ago I could barely move. Nearly crawling my way out of bed to attack the day (ahem‚Ä¶ night), after the long flight home.
I‚Äôve since returned to my regular routine of pacing around my studio (i.e. basement), between moments of awe e-mailing and ranting everywhere it seems appropriate (forums, twitter). As I exhausted all those wonderful forms of communication, it seemed to be right time to start the required retrospective post.</description>

      <description>Friday was the short day. Wednesday and Thursday we exhibited 10-6, where Friday was 10-3. Went back to the hotel and vegged that day, before heading back out to hang with the Fantastic Contraption guys.
My neighbors were the Secret Exit guys. I ended up spending a bulk of the show goofing off with Tuukka, an artist on Zen Bound. The Secret Exit guys refer to him as the ‚Äúprankster‚Äù of the bunch.</description>

      <description>First day of exhibiting. I have to say, I‚Äôm exhausted. Feet ached, and limped a bit throughout the day, but I loved it.
Here‚Äôs a few photos of the completed setup.

And a little closer.

I‚Äôm sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale.</description>

      <description>Live from San Fransisco, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ me.
As you may or may not have heard, I didn‚Äôt win. But that‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôm still here to exhibit.
We‚Äôre sharing booth space with the IGF main competition entrants, which is great. That way, when people come to see the cool IGF games, they‚Äôll find us too. Here‚Äôs my slice.

Other cool stuff, Apple put up a page of us IGF Mobile entries. Very awesome.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm back. This time, I‚Äôm ready for GDC!
Come take an early look at the madness I‚Äôm bringing with me to the conference.
As you can probably guess from the lack of Smiles PC/HD progress posts, I will not be demoing it at the conference. I am still bringing both laptops though. The big one will be doing something else instead.
Enjoy! üôÇ</description>

      <description>Yet another series, but video.
Part 1 of hopefully a few videos of me showing off my IGF preparations. Sinage, computers, etc.
3 weeks left and counting.
A bit roughly put together, but that‚Äôs half the point. I didn‚Äôt want it to eat up that much time, though it did take me some time to remember how to edit and encode a video (without my software crashing).
It‚Äôs no Goo Road to the IGF, but hey.</description>

Between now and then, I have a few commitments to take care of. Possibly a 2nd draft for my writing engagement, jury (selection?) duty, in addition to IGF preparations. It‚Äôs also an important turning point for Smiles as a product and a brand.¬†Lets talk about that.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs been 2 weeks, and much has happened.
As the topic suggests, Smiles Drop and Smiles Zen are now both available. $2.99 each, or save $1 by getting Smiles ($4.99).
So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out. As for blog content, I‚Äôm half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days‚Ä¶ and I sorta haven‚Äôt gone back to finish the post yet.</description>

      <description>I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, ‚ÄúSmiles Drop‚Äù. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.
So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.

Sykhronics Entertainment would like to introduce, Smiles. A brand new game now available for iPhone and iPod touch.
Smiles is a collection of 2 great games.
Smiles Drop is an unconventional action puzzle game. Unlike many others, you don‚Äôt have to wait to make your next move. In addition, you‚Äôre not pressured in to making that move either. Play at your own pace. Make matches, break ice and rocks, twisting and turning your way to higher scores.</description>

      <description>Final version of the Smiles video. It‚Äôs the short one again, but with me talking.
Here‚Äôs your chance to hear and mock Mike. I‚Äôve been getting a number of positive and amusing comments from the video. Such fun things as that I sound like an Infomercial host, and music sounds like ‚Äúcorporate training music‚Äù. Finishing this video has been an incredible hassle.

Search for ‚ÄúSmiles‚Äù and scroll down a bit, or browse the puzzle or strategy categories in iTunes.
Contrary to the description, it‚Äôs an Action Puzzler. Lumines/Metoes ‚Äòesc, or Bejeweled on crack.
Thanks to some fancy design kung fu, it‚Äôs also what the description says. But that‚Äôs a topic all in itself.

      <description>I‚Äôd love to say the wait is over, but now we start the next wait. Waiting for approval.
As of 7:45 AM this Tuesday October 28th morning, the game is now sent.

Digging through my SVN logs for some stats.
Repository was created on June 22nd, 2008. That‚Äôs a total of 4 months and 6 days.
All code, art (except the original TTF font, though I did design and make the logo text), and audio created by me.</description>

      <description>Wow, it‚Äôs been so long.
The last game I did TRC for was Atomic Betty, the Gameboy Advance game I worked on before leaving Big Blue Bubble. That would have been some time during July of 2005. That finished up, and I was a free man for August 1st.
By TRC I mean Technical Requirements Checklist. Every platform holder has them, though they sometimes have a different name for them. A TRC is a combination of guidelines.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs late, now 5 AM Saturday morning. Release Candidate 1 is just a few hours away. Some achievement tweaks, and minor bugs and we‚Äôre good.
Should go out to Apple on Monday afternoon. Then probably a week and it‚Äôll be live in the App Store.
I‚Äôd have taken a photo, but I‚Äôm currently cameraless.

The dummy website for the game:

Some time after it goes out, I‚Äôll make a proper site.</description>

      <description>Hypothetical situation.
Note: Try to refrain from bombard me with requests yet, ‚Äôcause I know a lot of people already like this idea.
cough, I‚Äôm in London, Ontario, Canada.A typical game company places 10 or more people under the same roof. Office space rented out at the expense of the company. There‚Äôs a management hierarchy, one or more people responsible for business and infrastructure aspects of the company, and an arrangement of programmers, artists, designers, possibly testers and a sound guy.</description>

      <description>Lets try a little experiment. (Try to) read this.
Sykhronics Entertainment
Anyone that‚Äôs followed my work probably won‚Äôt be miffed by that mean looking first word. But if you stuck around, you stuck around for my work, not my clever name. You probably have your own pronunciation of it too. I‚Äôve certainly heard some interesting ones from telemarketers that whois‚Äôd my domains for a phone number.
Lets see if we are thinking the same thing.</description>

      <description>This is from a forum post I made in response to a question on testing methods. A classic Mike random advice assault. This branched off to a series of thoughts on built in game recorders.
‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
Free testing methods:
Peer testing has worked well for me, as developers tend to have bizarre PC configurations (multiple monitors, multiple gamepads, etc). There‚Äôs also a level of critique a developer can give that goes above and beyond, but you need to be clear and capable of asking for the harshest of critiques.</description>

      <description>I was busy last month cutting together a trailer for‚Ä¶ business purposes. I‚Äôll talk more about this later. It turned out surprisingly more difficult that I had have hoped, but I found a rather unique way of pulling it together.
Obviously, the secret weapon is Fraps. Trying to nab constant 60fps footage was doable, but proved tricky, due to my hard drives not being the most defragged. I don‚Äôt know how many takes later, I ended up with nearly an hour of game footage, that was cut down to a 4 minute presentation.</description>

‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
Here‚Äôs a little job posting that I‚Äôve started to circulate.
[edit] Edited, ‚Äôcause it was rather technical and mean sounding. ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
Hi there,
We‚Äôre looking for a skilled 2D illustrator or animator for a 2 month contract, to start some time in February. The work can be done remotely. This is a full time contract, and I expect it to be on par with industry wages.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm actively preparing for ‚Ä¶ some event. On my to-do list for this miraculous day, is cleaning up the web sites. Well, I‚Äôve finished 1 so far, the Sykhronics web site.
www.sykhronics.com
It‚Äôs not functional, but I think it looks cooler/more professional than before. I‚Äôll make it usable at some later date.
Since it‚Äôs a new month, here‚Äôs a couple notable images from last month. The first is are a little sketch I did for each of my grandmother‚Äôs in their Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>I guess I‚Äôve been involved in games a long time. Doing ‚Äúamazing‚Äù things with ‚ÄúPRINT‚Äù on the Commodore 64 at the age of 9, and promoting a cheesy Zelda/Final Fantasy hybrid online at 16. Just to give some perspective, the year was 1996, and the game was called Legends of Tidal, a game the Internet has forgotten. Then there was all that game industry experience, but pshaw, nobody cares about that.</description>

I can‚Äôt even remember what it used to recommend instead of Sykhronics, but I‚Äôm glad to have finally made an impact. Woo. </description>

      <description>And here we are. Hopefully, it‚Äôs the start of a more regular practice. You‚Äôve probably read the brief Manifesto to the right. This was written some 9 months ago. And now, since things are a tad more orderly, it‚Äôs time to expand on that.
Sykhronics, pronounced ‚Äúpsi-cron-icks‚Äù. A branding of Mike Kasprzak‚Äôs independent game works. Established in 1998, replacing my older branding Gamma Flare Games. After bouncing around the gracious hosting of a few friends, I acquired the ‚Äúdot com‚Äù in 2000.</description>

      <description>There‚Äôs been a lot going on, which I‚Äôll go in to in further posts. This one‚Äôs on Logos.
Way back in July I dropped a note about some Rejected Logos. I still haven‚Äôt decided what I want, but I‚Äôve been back playing the logo making game.
Ahh yes, a smooth graphic design‚Äôish logo. Hurah.
Do I like it? I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm torn between going with something more cartoony, or including a little face in the logo.</description>

      <description>So begins the campaign. PuffBOMB.com/.net/.org are now online with this wonderful tease site. I‚Äôll have banners show up in the indie world soon, just to build some awareness. I have some big plans for this game.
IGF polishing goes well. Just a few more graphics, and some minor updates to the game itself, and we‚Äôre good to go.
2 days left. We‚Äôre looking good.</description>

      <description>On a mission to build corporate identity, the trials and tribulations of logo design. Given that introduction, ‚Ä¶ yeah, I was playing with logo design ideas. At the end of the day, I didn‚Äôt exactly come up with something to use. None the less, this is my blog, and I feel compelled to share it with myself, and any other misguided net travelers.
Here‚Äôs ‚ÄúGhastly logo‚Äú. For my own amusement, you can see it‚Äôs evolution below.</description>
