      <title>I am retiring from Indie Game Dev</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s true. After 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ll be wrapping up my games business. Later this year, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving on to other things.
I am still going to be around. I&amp;rsquo;d still like to attend GDC in San Francisco every year. Ludum Dare is a thing I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to work on and run (and if I&amp;rsquo;m lucky, I might be able to enter again some day). I&amp;rsquo;m also going to continue doing little projects that amuse me, things like my Commodore 64 game from New Years.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Modern Middlewares</title>

      <description>The following is some rambling. I have a point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make, but I&amp;rsquo;m certain I don&amp;rsquo;t make it. My fingers kept moving, and this is what resulted. You can kinda get an idea what sort of madness is bouncing around in the ‚Äòol noodle right now though. Good luck.
 *Big Sigh*
I&amp;rsquo;m typically a ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù, ‚Äúnative code is best‚Äù, ‚Äúc++ FTW‚Äù type of developer. The thing is, developers with my skillset and experience really are at a big disadvantage in today&amp;rsquo;s game market.</description>

      <description>This past weekend I began a process of rebranding my company. Shortly after leaving my AAA job in 2005, I created this logo.

Thing is, that&amp;rsquo;s not even one of the better logos I used, it&amp;rsquo;s just the most business&amp;rsquo;y one.
More here.
As you can see, I used to be really in to playing with typography. Sykhronics is a name I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for the past 15 years. In the early days, it was my portfolio website.</description>

      <description>Enough of this non-game talk.
The past month has been extremely good for progress. I did not meet my goal for the month, but I&amp;rsquo;d be silly to complain. Yadda yadda ya.
Against my better judgement, I&amp;rsquo;m going to stop beating around the bush and show you:
A mish-mash or random objects sitting in some sculpted terrain. Subtle glow. Vignette blur.
 That&amp;rsquo;s cool Mike, but what is it?

      <description>NAS time, again! Like before, I&amp;rsquo;m collecting my notes and thoughts all in one place.
Two months later Why have 1 when you can have 2? After winning the GameTree prize, I decided I should have 2
So according to my blog here, I&amp;rsquo;ve been running the Synology NAS for just over 2 months now, and I still love it. Heck, I bought a 2nd one! The NAS has become a permanent part of my development setup, and even my development workflow.</description>

      <description>Progress on the tech for my upcoming game ‚ÄúAlone, The‚Äù has been a little slow the past couple weeks, due to Ludum Dare, a nightmare of server issues (both LD and my own), and my upcoming move (OMG THAT&amp;rsquo;S RIGHT NOW). I have some great news to share though:

      <description>Continuing my prior post where I talk about my server replacement, a Synology NAS (DS211j). In essence, a cheap, tiny dedicated Linux box featuring an ARM CPU and custom web UI specially designed for SUPER EASY RAID array maintenance and creation. There&amp;rsquo;s a 4 drive version, some many-more drive versions, but they cost more.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;m here to talk about a little tool for getting your daily sales data from Apple&amp;rsquo;s iTunes Connect website.</description>

      <description>Last week, a drive in my server died. These drives weren&amp;rsquo;t really that old, but were Seagate&amp;rsquo;s from the drive failing epidemic a few years back. I bought 6 drives around this time, 4 for the server in a RAID 10 array, 2 for my workstation. I lost 1 to the failure problem, and the rest I managed to get updated firmwares installed in time.
Since then, I have been extremely leery of Seagate drives.</description>

      <description>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
  I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures.</description>

      <description>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I&amp;rsquo;ve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù.</description>

      <description>Yes, you read that right. It is ending. For real.
June 23rd is the 3 year anniversary of Smiles (as in, starting the game). I have finished every single port of the game that I had planned on doing (except console ports, both I decided to abort); Some are still in submission or need of final packaging. Days away now.
Today is June 15th, a whole week away from the anniversary.</description>

      <description>Hey, well that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Smiles for WP7 after a couple weeks.
Note, that&amp;rsquo;s cumulative&amp;hellip; which means total overall
Or according to my data: 9 trial downloads, and 1 sale since. There was some twitter talking, some retweets by fellow devs, but there&amp;rsquo;s practically no noticeable spike.
Ah well, so much for that. On to bigger better things.</description>

      <description>Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my ‚ÄúMicrosoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account‚Äù yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.
I made this game (Smiles), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:
  It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?</description>

      <description>The exact timing is a little off, but I today just renewed my business license.
Yes, 5 years ago July I left my job as Technical Director at Big Blue Bubble (now one of Canada&amp;rsquo;s largest game studios &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re welcome ;)). Here&amp;rsquo;s what I had to say.
 All systems are go!

Amazing. Today was my official last day at Big Blue Bubble. BBB was a great place to work, but I‚Äôm a too ambitious for my own good.</description>

      <description>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It&amp;rsquo;s been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me ‚Äî I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I&amp;rsquo;m there.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, I was inspired to start playing with logo designs. There&amp;rsquo;s no new decisions to be seen here in this post, just some ideas I&amp;rsquo;m playing with (and rejecting).
I actually used to make my own typography and font designs, one such example is this:
You can see more examples of prior logos here.
For the past 5 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this:
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ve ever really liked it, but it was good enough.</description>

      <description>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel&amp;rsquo;s AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement.</description>

      <description>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I&amp;rsquo;ll talk a little more about the ‚Äúday 1 FREE‚Äù experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device.</description>

      <description>Alright! The iPad is coming soon, as is a brand new version of Smiles.
As we speak I&amp;rsquo;m putting the finishing touches on Smiles HD, the all new higher resolution and slightly redesigned iPhone game coming soon to the iPad.
Now, in the eyes of Apple I&amp;rsquo;m nobody special. So like many of you, I&amp;rsquo;ll be heading down to my local Apple store on launch day to pick me up an iPad&amp;hellip; with one slight difference.</description>

      <description>Smiles has been available for nearly 6 months in the App Store now. From the stories you may have heard, not all iPhone titles necessarily do well. But if you consider that the game was developed by one person in 4 months, it lives under the charts, and has only 1 Apple mention to it&amp;rsquo;s name, it&amp;rsquo;s actually done alright. I&amp;rsquo;m hardly ‚Äúrolling in the dough‚Äù, but I can make ends meet.</description>

      <description>Just a few hours ago I could barely move. Nearly crawling my way out of bed to attack the day (ahem&amp;hellip; night), after the long flight home.
I&amp;rsquo;ve since returned to my regular routine of pacing around my studio (i.e. basement), between moments of awe e-mailing and ranting everywhere it seems appropriate (forums, twitter). As I exhausted all those wonderful forms of communication, it seemed to be right time to start the required retrospective post.</description>

      <description>Friday was the short day. Wednesday and Thursday we exhibited 10-6, where Friday was 10-3. Went back to the hotel and vegged that day, before heading back out to hang with the Fantastic Contraption guys.
My neighbors were the Secret Exit guys. I ended up spending a bulk of the show goofing off with Tuukka, an artist on Zen Bound. The Secret Exit guys refer to him as the ‚Äúprankster‚Äù of the bunch.</description>

      <description>First day of exhibiting. I have to say, I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted. Feet ached, and limped a bit throughout the day, but I loved it.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a few photos of the completed setup.
And a little closer.
I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a hotel with Phil Hassey of Galcon fame, and he had an amusing idea about creating some cheap signage. Hilighers and posterboard. At his booth he has a nicely done caracture of his goat Cuzco with a very supermarket-like sign advertising his sale.</description>

      <description>Live from San Fransisco, it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; me.
As you may or may not have heard, I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. But that&amp;rsquo;s alright, I&amp;rsquo;m still here to exhibit.
We&amp;rsquo;re sharing booth space with the IGF main competition entrants, which is great. That way, when people come to see the cool IGF games, they&amp;rsquo;ll find us too. Here&amp;rsquo;s my slice.
Other cool stuff, Apple put up a page of us IGF Mobile entries. Very awesome.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back. This time, I&amp;rsquo;m ready for GDC!
Come take an early look at the madness I&amp;rsquo;m bringing with me to the conference.
As you can probably guess from the lack of Smiles PC/HD progress posts, I will not be demoing it at the conference. I am still bringing both laptops though. The big one will be doing something else instead.
Enjoy! üôÇ</description>

      <description>Yet another series, but video.
Part 1 of hopefully a few videos of me showing off my IGF preparations. Sinage, computers, etc.
3 weeks left and counting.
A bit roughly put together, but that&amp;rsquo;s half the point. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want it to eat up that much time, though it did take me some time to remember how to edit and encode a video (without my software crashing).
It&amp;rsquo;s no Goo Road to the IGF, but hey.</description>

Between now and then, I have a few commitments to take care of. Possibly a 2nd draft for my writing engagement, jury (selection?) duty, in addition to IGF preparations. It&amp;rsquo;s also an important turning point for Smiles as a product and a brand.¬†Lets talk about that.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 weeks, and much has happened.
As the topic suggests, Smiles Drop and Smiles Zen are now both available. $2.99 each, or save $1 by getting Smiles ($4.99).
So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out. As for blog content, I&amp;rsquo;m half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days&amp;hellip; and I sorta haven&amp;rsquo;t gone back to finish the post yet.</description>

      <description>I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, ‚ÄúSmiles Drop‚Äù. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.
So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.
Wow&amp;hellip; I think I can finally take a weekend off now.</description>

If everything goes according to plan, it will be released bright and early Tuesday morning. This time, I explicitly set the date.

Sykhronics Entertainment would like to introduce, Smiles. A brand new game now available for iPhone and iPod touch.
Smiles is a collection of 2 great games.
Smiles Drop is an unconventional action puzzle game. Unlike many others, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait to make your next move. In addition, you&amp;rsquo;re not pressured in to making that move either. Play at your own pace. Make matches, break ice and rocks, twisting and turning your way to higher scores.</description>

      <description>Final version of the Smiles video. It&amp;rsquo;s the short one again, but with me talking.
Here&amp;rsquo;s your chance to hear and mock Mike. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting a number of positive and amusing comments from the video. Such fun things as that I sound like an Infomercial host, and music sounds like ‚Äúcorporate training music‚Äù. Finishing this video has been an incredible hassle. Hard drives dying, frequent reboots, loss of WAV file playback in Windows, and YouTube difficulties.</description>

Search for ‚ÄúSmiles‚Äù and scroll down a bit, or browse the puzzle or strategy categories in iTunes.
Contrary to the description, it&amp;rsquo;s an Action Puzzler. Lumines/Metoes ‚Äòesc, or Bejeweled on crack.
Thanks to some fancy design kung fu, it&amp;rsquo;s also what the description says. But that&amp;rsquo;s a topic all in itself.

The last game I did TRC for was Atomic Betty, the Gameboy Advance game I worked on before leaving Big Blue Bubble. That would have been some time during July of 2005. That finished up, and I was a free man for August 1st.
By TRC I mean Technical Requirements Checklist. Every platform holder has them, though they sometimes have a different name for them. A TRC is a combination of guidelines.</description>

cough, I&amp;rsquo;m in London, Ontario, Canada.A typical game company places 10 or more people under the same roof. Office space rented out at the expense of the company. There&amp;rsquo;s a management hierarchy, one or more people responsible for business and infrastructure aspects of the company, and an arrangement of programmers, artists, designers, possibly testers and a sound guy.</description>

Sykhronics Entertainment Anyone that&amp;rsquo;s followed my work probably won&amp;rsquo;t be miffed by that mean looking first word.

      <description>This is from a forum post I made in response to a question on testing methods. A classic Mike random advice assault. This branched off to a series of thoughts on built in game recorders.
‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
Free testing methods:
Peer testing has worked well for me, as developers tend to have bizarre PC configurations (multiple monitors, multiple gamepads, etc). There&amp;rsquo;s also a level of critique a developer can give that goes above and beyond, but you need to be clear and capable of asking for the harshest of critiques.</description>

      <description>I was busy last month cutting together a trailer for&amp;hellip; business purposes. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about this later. It turned out surprisingly more difficult that I had have hoped, but I found a rather unique way of pulling it together.
Obviously, the secret weapon is Fraps. Trying to nab constant 60fps footage was doable, but proved tricky, due to my hard drives not being the most defragged. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many takes later, I ended up with nearly an hour of game footage, that was cut down to a 4 minute presentation.</description>

Hi there,
We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a skilled 2D illustrator or animator for a 2 month contract, to start some time in February. The work can be done remotely. This is a full time contract, and I expect it to be on par with industry wages.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m actively preparing for &amp;hellip; some event. On my to-do list for this miraculous day, is cleaning up the web sites. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished 1 so far, the Sykhronics web site.
www.sykhronics.com
It&amp;rsquo;s not functional, but I think it looks cooler/more professional than before. I&amp;rsquo;ll make it usable at some later date.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s a new month, here&amp;rsquo;s a couple notable images from last month. The first is are a little sketch I did for each of my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s in their Christmas cards.</description>

      <description>I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in games a long time. Doing ‚Äúamazing‚Äù things with ‚ÄúPRINT‚Äù on the Commodore 64 at the age of 9, and promoting a cheesy Zelda/Final Fantasy hybrid online at 16. Just to give some perspective, the year was 1996, and the game was called Legends of Tidal, a game the Internet has forgotten. Then there was all that game industry experience, but pshaw, nobody cares about that.</description>

      <description>One way to know if you&amp;rsquo;re established on the net.
I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember what it used to recommend instead of Sykhronics, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have finally made an impact. Woo. </description>

      <title>Welcome to Sykoland</title>

      <description>And here we are. Hopefully, it&amp;rsquo;s the start of a more regular practice. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably read the brief Manifesto to the right. This was written some 9 months ago. And now, since things are a tad more orderly, it&amp;rsquo;s time to expand on that.
Sykhronics, pronounced ‚Äúpsi-cron-icks‚Äù. A branding of Mike Kasprzak&amp;rsquo;s independent game works. Established in 1998, replacing my older branding Gamma Flare Games. After bouncing around the gracious hosting of a few friends, I acquired the ‚Äúdot com‚Äù in 2000.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot going on, which I&amp;rsquo;ll go in to in further posts. This one&amp;rsquo;s on Logos.
Way back in July I dropped a note about some Rejected Logos. I still haven&amp;rsquo;t decided what I want, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been back playing the logo making game.
Ahh yes, a smooth graphic design&amp;rsquo;ish logo. Hurah.
Do I like it? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. I&amp;rsquo;m torn between going with something more cartoony, or including a little face in the logo.</description>

      <title>Blam!  Teaser</title>

      <description>So begins the campaign. PuffBOMB.com/.net/.org are now online with this wonderful tease site. I&amp;rsquo;ll have banners show up in the indie world soon, just to build some awareness. I have some big plans for this game.
IGF polishing goes well. Just a few more graphics, and some minor updates to the game itself, and we&amp;rsquo;re good to go.
2 days left. We&amp;rsquo;re looking good.</description>

      <description>On a mission to build corporate identity, the trials and tribulations of logo design. Given that introduction, &amp;hellip; yeah, I was playing with logo design ideas. At the end of the day, I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly come up with something to use. None the less, this is my blog, and I feel compelled to share it with myself, and any other misguided net travelers.
Here&amp;rsquo;s ‚ÄúGhastly logo‚Äú. For my own amusement, you can see it&amp;rsquo;s evolution below.</description>
