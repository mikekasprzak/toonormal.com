    <h1 class="post-title">I am retiring from Indie Game Dev</h1>

  <div class="post-content"><p>It‚Äôs true. After 10 years, I‚Äôll be wrapping up my games business. Later this year, I‚Äôll be moving on to other things.</p>
<p>I am still going to be around. I‚Äôd still like to attend <a href="http://www.gdconf.com"><strong>GDC</strong></a> in San Francisco every year. <a href="http://ludumdare.com"><strong>Ludum Dare</strong></a> is a thing I‚Äôll continue to work on and run (and if I‚Äôm lucky, I might be able to enter again some day). I‚Äôm also going to continue doing little projects that amuse me, things like <a href="https://vine.co/v/OwxPlxgVTYn">my Commodore 64 game</a> from New Years. Really, not much is changing today. But it is time for me to move on from the Indie games business.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to try supporting myself with some non-game projects. I‚Äôll talk more about what I‚Äôm doing in the coming months. As for the so called ‚ÄúIndie Games Business‚Äù, I just don‚Äôt trust it anymore, and that‚Äôs that.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for all your support.</p>

    <p>The following is some rambling. I have a point I‚Äôm trying to make, but I‚Äôm certain I don‚Äôt make it. My fingers kept moving, and this is what resulted. You can kinda get an idea what sort of madness is bouncing around in the ‚Äòol noodle right now though. Good luck.
 *Big Sigh*
I‚Äôm typically a ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù, ‚Äúnative code is best‚Äù, ‚Äúc&#43;&#43; FTW‚Äù type of developer. The thing is, developers with my skillset and experience really are at a big disadvantage in today‚Äôs game market....</p>

    <h2>The Rebranding of Sykhronics</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This past weekend I began a process of rebranding my company. Shortly after leaving my AAA job in 2005, I created this logo.

Thing is, that‚Äôs not even one of the better logos I used, it‚Äôs just the most business‚Äôy one.
More here.
As you can see, I used to be really in to playing with typography. Sykhronics is a name I‚Äôve been using for the past 15 years. In the early days, it was my portfolio website....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>NAS time, again! Like before, I‚Äôm collecting my notes and thoughts all in one place.
Two months later As mentioned in my earlier posts, I‚Äôm running both SVN and AppDailySales on it (iTunes Connect Sales Stat grabber). In addition, I‚Äôve been running an internal wiki on it. I used to host 2 different external wikis, but both have been imported and archived locally.
I chose DokuWiki for my internal wiki because it uses flat files, meaning I don‚Äôt have to run SQL (though it is just a button to enable MySQL on the Synology)....</p>

    <h2>AppDailySales, and running on Synology NAS Devices</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Continuing my prior post where I talk about my server replacement, a Synology NAS (DS211j). In essence, a cheap, tiny dedicated Linux box featuring an ARM CPU and custom web UI specially designed for SUPER EASY RAID array maintenance and creation. There‚Äôs a 4 drive version, some many-more drive versions, but they cost more.
This time, I‚Äôm here to talk about a little tool for getting your daily sales data from Apple‚Äôs iTunes Connect website. AppDailySales!
http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/
This is a python script I was recommended some months back, but it needed a few things IMO. So in a shocking rare case of OSS justice, I added the features I wanted myself and submitted a patch:
http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/issues/detail?id=31&amp;can=1
Just a few days ago (nine months later), version 2.9 was released (sparked by Apple‚Äôs change to the system), now including my patches! üòÄ
To run the script, all you need is Python. Before I used to run this on Windows XP (Python installed in C:\Python2.7, with PATH environment variable set to include this).
Now with the NAS, I SSH in to the device (Go download Putty if on Windows), login as root (same password as admin), and install the python package.
ipkg install python
Easy. Done.
Place the AppDailySales.py script somewhere on your computer, likely in the same folder you want your stats placed. Then simply invoke it with ‚Äìhelp to get a list of arguments.
python appdailysales.py --help
I run it from a batch file or script. My old Batch File Version looks like this:
The new, shockingly similar shell script version (i.e. only single %‚Äôs) is this:
This creates files like so:
2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-13.txt&lt;br /&gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-12.txt&lt;br /&gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-11.txt&lt;br /&gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-10.txt
Nice and easy to read names, unlike the default files generated by iTunes Connect.
In the next section, I‚Äôll talk more about setting it up as a service. In other words, totally automated!

    <h2>I am running a Synology NAS now</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Last week, a drive in my server died. These drives weren‚Äôt really that old, but were Seagate‚Äôs from the drive failing epidemic a few years back. I bought 6 drives around this time, 4 for the server in a RAID 10 array, 2 for my workstation. I lost 1 to the failure problem, and the rest I managed to get updated firmwares installed in time.
Since then, I have been extremely leery of Seagate drives. My server ran Windows XP (yes), and used the on-board Intel SATA RAID controller of this MOBO. On several occasions, the RAID integrity would fail for no good reason upon bootup, that I simply stopped turning my server off.
My brother the ‚Äúprofessional network admin‚Äù has been reminding me for years that Software Linux RAID is the best RAID. So after this tragic failure (no data lost, just some hair), it was time for something different.
My brother and I have been talking NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices for a while, he himself trying a few over the years, to really sub-par results. Generally, the prices were terrible for completely sub par hardware that couldn‚Äôt perform. Popular NAS like the Drobo start at like $700, yuck! The best bang for buck always seemed to be building a server.
Actually, bang for buck wise, building your own file server is still cheaper. But Linux is a delicate mistress. I am a coder, and dealing with game console development tools and Linux setups over the years has taught me how to live comfortably in Linux. I work on Windows though, just I do it with Cygwin and MinGW/MSys.
That aside, there is still too much sh*t to learn about Linux. Time is money. Building and maintaining another server, I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt want to do it (FreeNAS was suggested on my Twitter, for anyone in a more adventurous mood).
It‚Äôs 2011, give me a drop in solution that‚Äôs cheap, small, fast and good!
Blam! Hello Synology DS211j!
This 2 drive consumer model rakes in at around $200, size not much larger than an eternal casing, and sporting a 1.2 GHz ARM processor. ARM! Hey! I know those!
It runs a breed of Linux, interfaces via gorgeous fast HTML UI, and support fancy Linux favorites like SSH out-of-the-box. Well not quite out-of-the-box, as you do need to download the latest firmware and a setup tool for your OS, but that‚Äôs easy.
Mine I filed with a pair of 3TB Hitachi Deskstar drives, spinning at 7200 RPMS with 64 MB of cache. Western Digital Caviar Green drives were $40 cheaper each, but are known to be slow and problematic on RAIDs (though there are fixes, a tool WDidle3 seems to address this). Again, time is da mon-nay, and wanted something I could just drop in. Benchmarks said these drives were better overall performers too, so hey, why not!
Hardware setup was a matter of unboxing, opening it (sliding case sides front and back to unlock), plugging my drives in, screwing them in, and closing the casing (opposite of opening). I think I had this done in 5 minutes, max. Didn‚Äôt even need a manual.
Building the array I wanted (MODE 1) was extremely straightforward, that I wont both talking about it.
What I will talk about is some of the advanced stuff I wanted from it, and the configuring done to make it act accordingly. After all, this blog post is actually for me, so I can know what I did in case I need to reproduce it.
