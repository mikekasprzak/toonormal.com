    <h1 class="post-title">I am retiring from Indie Game Dev</h1>
    <div class="post-meta">Mike K · June 29, 2015

  </header>
  <div class="post-content"><p>It&rsquo;s true. After 10 years, I&rsquo;ll be wrapping up my games business. Later this year, I&rsquo;ll be moving on to other things.</p>
<p>I am still going to be around. I&rsquo;d still like to attend <a href="http://www.gdconf.com"><strong>GDC</strong></a> in San Francisco every year. <a href="http://ludumdare.com"><strong>Ludum Dare</strong></a> is a thing I&rsquo;ll continue to work on and run (and if I&rsquo;m lucky, I might be able to enter again some day). I&rsquo;m also going to continue doing little projects that amuse me, things like <a href="https://vine.co/v/OwxPlxgVTYn">my Commodore 64 game</a> from New Years. Really, not much is changing today. But it is time for me to move on from the Indie games business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try supporting myself with some non-game projects. I&rsquo;ll talk more about what I&rsquo;m doing in the coming months. As for the so called “Indie Games Business”, I just don&rsquo;t trust it anymore, and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for all your support.</p>

    <p>The following is some rambling. I have a point I’m trying to make, but I’m certain I don’t make it. My fingers kept moving, and this is what resulted. You can kinda get an idea what sort of madness is bouncing around in the ‘ol noodle right now though. Good luck.
 *Big Sigh*
I’m typically a “from scratch”, “native code is best”, “c&#43;&#43; FTW” type of developer. The thing is, developers with my skillset and experience really are at a big disadvantage in today’s game market....</p>

    <h2>The Rebranding of Sykhronics</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This past weekend I began a process of rebranding my company. Shortly after leaving my AAA job in 2005, I created this logo.

Thing is, that’s not even one of the better logos I used, it’s just the most business’y one.
More here.
As you can see, I used to be really in to playing with typography. Sykhronics is a name I’ve been using for the past 15 years. In the early days, it was my portfolio website....</p>

    <p>Enough of this non-game talk.
The past month has been extremely good for progress. I did not meet my goal for the month, but I’d be silly to complain. Yadda yadda ya.
Against my better judgement, I’m going to stop beating around the bush and show you:
A mish-mash or random objects sitting in some sculpted terrain. Subtle glow. Vignette blur.
 That’s cool Mike, but what is it?

    <p>NAS time, again! Like before, I’m collecting my notes and thoughts all in one place.
Two months later Why have 1 when you can have 2? After winning the GameTree prize, I decided I should have 2
So according to my blog here, I’ve been running the Synology NAS for just over 2 months now, and I still love it. Heck, I bought a 2nd one! The NAS has become a permanent part of my development setup, and even my development workflow....</p>

    <p>Continuing my prior post where I talk about my server replacement, a Synology NAS (DS211j). In essence, a cheap, tiny dedicated Linux box featuring an ARM CPU and custom web UI specially designed for SUPER EASY RAID array maintenance and creation. There’s a 4 drive version, some many-more drive versions, but they cost more.
This time, I’m here to talk about a little tool for getting your daily sales data from Apple’s iTunes Connect website....</p>

    <p>Last week, a drive in my server died. These drives weren’t really that old, but were Seagate’s from the drive failing epidemic a few years back. I bought 6 drives around this time, 4 for the server in a RAID 10 array, 2 for my workstation. I lost 1 to the failure problem, and the rest I managed to get updated firmwares installed in time.
Since then, I have been extremely leery of Seagate drives....</p>
