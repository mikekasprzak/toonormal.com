    <p>I‚Äôm back. This time, I‚Äôm ready for GDC!
Come take an early look at the madness I‚Äôm bringing with me to the conference.
As you can probably guess from the lack of Smiles PC/HD progress posts, I will not be demoing it at the conference. I am still bringing both laptops though. The big one will be doing something else instead.
Enjoy! üôÇ...</p>

    <p>Yet another series, but video.
Part 1 of hopefully a few videos of me showing off my IGF preparations. Sinage, computers, etc.
3 weeks left and counting.
A bit roughly put together, but that‚Äôs half the point. I didn‚Äôt want it to eat up that much time, though it did take me some time to remember how to edit and encode a video (without my software crashing).
It‚Äôs no Goo Road to the IGF, but hey....</p>

    <p>Alright, so the clock says it‚Äôs Friday now. According to my whiteboard, that‚Äôs 29 days before I leave for the Game Developers Conference. Between now and then, I have a few commitments to take care of. Possibly a 2nd draft for my writing engagement, jury (selection?) duty, in addition to IGF preparations. It‚Äôs also an important turning point for Smiles as a product and a brand.¬†Lets talk about that....</p>

    <p>It‚Äôs been 2 weeks, and much has happened.
As the topic suggests, Smiles Drop and Smiles Zen are now both available. $2.99 each, or save $1 by getting Smiles ($4.99).
So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out. As for blog content, I‚Äôm half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days‚Ä¶ and I sorta haven‚Äôt gone back to finish the post yet....</p>

    <p>I just finished up the other half of the game split a couple hours ago, ‚ÄúSmiles Drop‚Äù. It needs some testing first, but it should be off to Apple early/mid next week.
So here we are. Just over 3 weeks after finishing Smiles. Finished a video, finished a web site, finished a press release, finished contacting the websites, and now finished my releases for the next couple weeks.
Wow‚Ä¶ I think I can finally take a weekend off now....</p>

    <p>Part one of my rebellion against the iPhone price drop madness has begun. Smiles Zen, the standalone version of Zen is now sent to Apple.
If everything goes according to plan, it will be released bright and early Tuesday morning. This time, I explicitly set the date.

In other news, a new review.

OSX Reality ‚Äì 4 Stars. Incredibly favorable review. Their only beef was that they expect a price drop for it to be competitive....</p>

    <p>London, Ontario, Canada ‚Äì November 12th, 2008
Sykhronics Entertainment would like to introduce, Smiles. A brand new game now available for iPhone and iPod touch.
Smiles is a collection of 2 great games.
Smiles Drop is an unconventional action puzzle game. Unlike many others, you don‚Äôt have to wait to make your next move. In addition, you‚Äôre not pressured in to making that move either. Play at your own pace. Make matches, break ice and rocks, twisting and turning your way to higher scores....</p>
