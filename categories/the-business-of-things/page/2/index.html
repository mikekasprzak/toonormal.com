    <h2>Conversation: Business and Fear</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures....</p>

    <h2>Introducing: The Indie Indie Conversation</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I‚Äôve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I‚Äôve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù....</p>

    <h2>Ending Smiles</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Yes, you read that right. It is ending. For real.
June 23rd is the 3 year anniversary of Smiles (as in, starting the game). I have finished every single port of the game that I had planned on doing (except console ports, both I decided to abort); Some are still in submission or need of final packaging. Days away now.
Today is June 15th, a whole week away from the anniversary....</p>

    <p>Hey, well that didn‚Äôt work. Smiles for WP7 after a couple weeks.
Or according to my data: 9 trial downloads, and 1 sale since. There was some twitter talking, some retweets by fellow devs, but there‚Äôs practically no noticeable spike.
Ah well, so much for that. On to bigger better things....</p>

    <p>Hi. I just received a 2nd e-mail informing me my ‚ÄúMicrosoft Windows Phone Marketplace developer account‚Äù yearly membership needs to be renewed. That costs $99 USD, and I think I paid $129 CAD.
I made this game (Smiles), and I paid a friend to work with me to port it to Windows Phone 7:
It was available on launch day for Windows Phone 7. Looks like a pretty well made game, right?...</p>

    <p>The exact timing is a little off, but I today just renewed my business license.
Yes, 5 years ago July I left my job as Technical Director at Big Blue Bubble (now one of Canada‚Äôs largest game studios ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre welcome ;)). Here‚Äôs what I had to say.
 All systems are go!

    <p>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It‚Äôs been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me ‚Äî I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I‚Äôm there....</p>

    <p>For whatever reason, I was inspired to start playing with logo designs. There‚Äôs no new decisions to be seen here in this post, just some ideas I‚Äôm playing with (and rejecting).
I actually used to make my own typography and font designs, one such example is this:
You can see more examples of prior logos here.
For the past 5 years I‚Äôve been using this:

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever really liked it, but it was good enough....</p>
