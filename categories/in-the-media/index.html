  <div class="post-content"><p>Progress on the tech for my upcoming game ‚ÄúAlone, The‚Äù has been a little slow the past couple weeks, due to <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a>, a nightmare of server issues (both LD and my own), and my upcoming move (OMG THAT&rsquo;S RIGHT NOW). I have some great news to share though:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="transgaming-announces-winner-of-the-10000-gametree-developer-competition-developers-choice-award">TransGaming Announces Winner of the $10,000 GameTree Developer Competition: Developer&rsquo;s Choice Award</h3>
<p>Developers from around the world have their say: Smiles HD takes home the prize</p>
<p><strong>TORONTO, CANADA ‚Äì August 31, 2011</strong> ‚Äì TransGaming Inc. (TSX-V:TNG), the global leader in the multiplatform deployment of games, today announced Smiles HD by Sykhronics Entertainment as the winner of their GameTree Developer Competition: Developer&rsquo;s Choice Award.</p>
<p>Smiles HD is an award-winning puzzle/matching game featuring inventive game modes, engaging achievements and family-friendly themes. This immersive but ‚Äúsnackable‚Äù game experience involves spinning, swapping and dropping smiling objects to create huge combos and even bigger scores. After incredible commercial and critical success on the iPhone and iPad, Smiles HD was easily enabled on the next generation GameTree TV gaming platform for Smart TV.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe amazing opportunity presented by TransGaming‚Äôs GameTree Developer Competition allows an independent developer such as myself to easily reach a growing market on an exciting new platform‚Äù, said Michael Kasprzak of Sykhronics Entertainment. ‚ÄúWith TransGaming&rsquo;s help and the GameTree TV SDK, Smiles HD was enabled on GameTree TV in a matter of hours.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe wanted our GameTree Developer Competition to truly engage the talented independent game development community in order to be able to discover and deliver innovative and creative interactive entertainment to our GameTree TV consumers. The Developer&rsquo;s Choice Award gave GameTree Developers a voice to choose the best among their peers‚Äù, commented Vikas Gupta, CEO and President of TransGaming. ‚ÄúThis indie development community is creating revolutionary games like Smiles HD which we know will be enjoyed by the GameTree TV audience, and TransGaming is dedicated to finding and rewarding that talent.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a big fan of the outcome. üòÄ</p>
<p>Smiles HD should go live on ‚ÄúFree‚Äù set-top boxes in France soon.</p>

    <p>Towlr recently frustrated attendees at ‚ÄúN Design‚Äù, an art-game exhibit in Curitiba, Brazil. Very cool!
Here are some photos of the event.
On your left, take note of the bright eye burning red

Several other favorites were at the event, included a Rohrer game, a Terry Cavanagh game, and of course, Braid.

    <p>Heh, I certainly wasn‚Äôt expecting this.
Pay no attention to the grammar tense of the first sentence
RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I‚Äôm now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I‚Äôve been using UltraVNC on my PC‚Äôs recently, though I do run their iPhone client. üòâ
Thanks for the tip Adam....</p>

    <p>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel‚Äôs AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement....</p>

    <p>So, holy cow! GDC was absolutely insane! I almost don‚Äôt know where to start, but lets start from the beginning.
First thing first, I won again!!
Argh! They used that squished photo again! I even sent them a square one!
Yes, as if winning a free car wasn‚Äôt enough, I also won a free trip to GDC. So Intel ended up covering my flight, putting me up in a fancy hotel, gave me some spending money, treating me to dinner, AND giving me nearly front row seats to a San Jose Sharks hockey game!...</p>

    <p>Ordinarily, greeting someone by glancing at their chest might be seen as a little rude (especially a lady), but at GDC it‚Äôs encouraged! Yes I‚Äôm talking about the passes, not making a pass.
The passes do a good job of helping you connect a face to a name, and even a company, but you don‚Äôt always know who made or represents what. GDC passes include a relatively large pocket, so you could either make something to insert behind your name card, or cover the pass with some strategically placed stickers....</p>
