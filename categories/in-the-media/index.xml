      <description>Progress on the tech for my upcoming game ‚ÄúAlone, The‚Äù has been a little slow the past couple weeks, due to Ludum Dare, a nightmare of server issues (both LD and my own), and my upcoming move (OMG THAT&amp;rsquo;S RIGHT NOW). I have some great news to share though:
 TransGaming Announces Winner of the $10,000 GameTree Developer Competition: Developer&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award Developers from around the world have their say: Smiles HD takes home the prize</description>

      <description>No sir. Do not pass go, do not collect $50,000.
  However! All is not lost!
I am still eligible for a the $10k ‚ÄúDevelopers Choice‚Äù award, which means you, you developers! Visit GameTreeDeveloper.com and cast your vote (For Smiles HD). üòÄ</description>

      <description>The latest in the world of Mike, I might win something again.
  I&amp;rsquo;m less than an hour away from finding out if it&amp;rsquo;s true, so here&amp;rsquo;s me killing minutes as I wait.</description>

      <description>Towlr recently frustrated attendees at ‚ÄúN Design‚Äù, an art-game exhibit in Curitiba, Brazil. Very cool!
Here are some photos of the event.
On your left, take note of the bright eye burning red
Descriptions floating on the wall &amp;ndash; Very classy
Several other favorites were at the event, included a Rohrer game, a Terry Cavanagh game, and of course, Braid.

      <description>Heh, I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting this.
Pay no attention to the grammar tense of the first sentence
RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I&amp;rsquo;m now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using UltraVNC on my PC&amp;rsquo;s recently, though I do run their iPhone client. üòâ
Thanks for the tip Adam.</description>

      <description>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel&amp;rsquo;s AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement.</description>

      <description>Oh hey. Like literally an hour or two after that big epic blog post of mine, Apple let us know we could submit early. So I crunched the game together and did exactly that.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some final video footage of the game.</description>

      <title>Mike the Multi-Winner and GDC Champion</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/03/18/mike-the-multi-winner-and-gdc-champion/</guid>
      <description>So, holy cow! GDC was absolutely insane! I almost don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start, but lets start from the beginning.
First thing first, I won again!!
Argh! They used that squished photo again! I even sent them a square one!
Yes, as if winning a free car wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, I also won a free trip to GDC. So Intel ended up covering my flight, putting me up in a fancy hotel, gave me some spending money, treating me to dinner, AND giving me nearly front row seats to a San Jose Sharks hockey game!</description>

      <title>Mike&#39;s GDC 2010 Schedule</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/03/06/mikes-gdc-2010-schedule/</guid>
      <description>For the benefit of friends and people I&amp;rsquo;m meeting at the show, here&amp;rsquo;s a run down of my itinerary for GDC. I&amp;rsquo;ll also be tweeting and watching twitter while I&amp;rsquo;m down for any impromptu meets, hang-outs, and whatever with people I know. If the twitter says ‚Äútotally bored‚Äù, then you know. üôÇ
If anybody I know needs my cell number, send me a quick e-mail (mike AT sykhronics dot com). It&amp;rsquo;s not my usual cell, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be my number whilst I&amp;rsquo;m in San Fran.</description>

      <title>Personalizing your GDC pass</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2010/03/04/personalizing-your-gdc-pass/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/03/04/personalizing-your-gdc-pass/</guid>
      <description>Ordinarily, greeting someone by glancing at their chest might be seen as a little rude (especially a lady), but at GDC it&amp;rsquo;s encouraged! Yes I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the passes, not making a pass.
The passes do a good job of helping you connect a face to a name, and even a company, but you don&amp;rsquo;t always know who made or represents what. GDC passes include a relatively large pocket, so you could either make something to insert behind your name card, or cover the pass with some strategically placed stickers.</description>

      <title>A Very Different GDC (for me)</title>

      <description>So last year, I was an IGF Mobile finalist. This little game of mine stood alongside iPhone favorites like Edge and Fieldrunners, vying for the ‚ÄúBest Mobile Game‚Äù award. And if I had won, &amp;hellip; well, I have no idea. Even just being a finalist has been great for me, so I&amp;rsquo;d image it would have been MORE great. üòâ
That was 2009, and this is 2010.
This year started out as my ‚Äúlow key‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù GDC.</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/02/03/the-intel-is-awesome-post/</guid>
      <description>So hey. Back in December I finished up a 1.0 port of Smiles for Netbooks, and sent it to Intel by their early contest deadline.
And hey, guess what?
Advice: whenever somebody asks for a photo, send a square one, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t ask for square.
Link here.
Second place! That&amp;rsquo;s awesome. üòÄ
So hey, what does 2nd place actually mean?
Yes, I won a car by making games. That&amp;rsquo;s just&amp;hellip; wow!</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/01/01/mikes-2009/</guid>
      <description>So wow. That&amp;rsquo;s finally it for 2009. Like doing taxes ever year, I feel a special sort of obligation that I write some sort of retrospective, especially after such an eventful year as this one. Far more awesome than taxes. üòâ
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where to start, so I ended up categorizing aspects of the year. I&amp;rsquo;ll free form rant about each topic as I come to it.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.</description>

      <description>First on the agenda, the book is real.
As you can see above, my three complimentary copies showed up in the mail today. Word from the Dread Pirate himself (i.e. Lead Author/Tech Reviewer) is the books should be en route, if not already arriving at book stores all over the place. After all, the guy in Canada got his. üòâ

      <description>Crawling out of bed early this morning, I made the weird decision that it&amp;rsquo;d be a blogging morning. It seems I&amp;rsquo;ve stockpiled a few interesting things to talk about. I&amp;rsquo;m nearly ready to start talking about the new project too, but as the title suggests, I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about the other stuff today.
First thing on the agenda, Ludum Dare. I wanted to follow up that prior post of mine with a brief finale post.</description>

      <title>Smile Zen and Drop Available, News</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2008/12/05/smile-zen-and-drop-available-news/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 weeks, and much has happened.
As the topic suggests, Smiles Drop and Smiles Zen are now both available. $2.99 each, or save $1 by getting Smiles ($4.99).
So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out. As for blog content, I&amp;rsquo;m half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days&amp;hellip; and I sorta haven&amp;rsquo;t gone back to finish the post yet.</description>

      <description>Part one of my rebellion against the iPhone price drop madness has begun. Smiles Zen, the standalone version of Zen is now sent to Apple.
If everything goes according to plan, it will be released bright and early Tuesday morning. This time, I explicitly set the date.

In other news, a new review.
http://osxreality.com/&amp;hellip;/a-relaxing-matching-game-with-fun-graphics/
OSX Reality ‚Äì 4 Stars. Incredibly favorable review. Their only beef was that they expect a price drop for it to be competitive.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m still working diligently to assemble my complete press package. Putting the final touches on that video, writing the press release, e-mails, all that fun stuff.
But as part of my procrastination routine, I&amp;rsquo;m hitting my usual list of sites. IndieGames, ‚ÄúThe Sauce‚Äù, etc. And as I get to the iPhone gaming sites, I&amp;rsquo;m hit with this euphoric stupor.
‚ÄúDude! That&amp;rsquo;s me!‚Äù

      <description>It seems I missed the memo.
The 2nd Independent Games compilation was released back in September (25th), and that PuffBOMB game I seem to talk about all the time was included.
As well, there was a set of concept art included in the package. Said art can also be seen right here.
I suppose I should go find a way to acquire a copy, &amp;lsquo;cause I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what happened to a complimentary one.</description>
