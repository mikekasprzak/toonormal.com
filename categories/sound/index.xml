      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something different.
Been working on the HTML5 side of my library code, and I kinda made this little demo for fun. Music is Garth Knight&amp;rsquo;s track Activate the Cage.
Ludum Dare 30 is this weekend. Hoo boy! Running that crazyfest is keeping me sooo busy. üôÇ</description>

      <description>I am a regular twitter user. I run a client (twhirl) in the corner of my right monitor, so for me it works like a weird combination of an IM client and RSS reader.
A couple days ago, I caught glance of this request from Noel Llopis (developer of Flower Garden, Dr. Seuss&amp;rsquo; Lorax Garden, and the upcoming Casey‚Äôs Contraptions).

That&amp;rsquo;s a good question. As far as I know there&amp;rsquo;s no real ‚Äústandard‚Äù achievement sound (unless you want to rip-off Microsoft).</description>

      <description>Oh boy!
Nothing significant, I just forgot how amusing some of this stuff can be. Taken from 1950&amp;rsquo;s PSA called ‚ÄúDuck and Cover‚Äú, via Archive.org.
Then I started playing with clips from the PSA.
Have a good day.</description>

      <title>Trackers and Sequencers rant</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2007/03/25/trackers-and-sequencers-rant/</link>

      <description>Ranting&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ve been ‚Äúwriting‚Äù music with trackers for about 13 years (Scream, Impulse, Modplug, Buzz, Renoise). Alas, my results have been less than satisfactory. I want to take this moment to apologize to everyone I ever recommended trackers to.
Sorry.
Sometime last month I set out to find a better music app. I&amp;rsquo;d already entered the world of VST&amp;rsquo;s thanks to Renoise, having put down a big $600 for Colossus.</description>

      <title>An audio workflow with SVN (Rant)</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2006/08/22/an-audio-workflow-with-svn-rant/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got workflow on the brain, and a discussion about backups on IG got the brain juices flowing. The post is of similar quality and length to what I&amp;rsquo;d normally constitute a ‚Äúblog post‚Äù, so I&amp;rsquo;m dropping it here so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not a surefire answer to anything, just a stroll through me solving a problem.
The set up: SVN, a great tool for backups, versioning, and synchronization, can and should be used in all aspects of development.</description>
