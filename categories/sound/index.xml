      <description>Here‚Äôs something different.
Been working on the HTML5 side of my library code, and I kinda made this little demo for fun. Music is Garth Knight‚Äôs track Activate the Cage.
Ludum Dare 30 is this weekend. Hoo boy! Running that crazyfest is keeping me sooo busy. üôÇ</description>

      <description>I am a regular twitter user. I run a client (twhirl) in the corner of my right monitor, so for me it works like a weird combination of an IM client and RSS reader.
A couple days ago, I caught glance of this request from Noel Llopis (developer of Flower Garden, Dr. Seuss‚Äô Lorax Garden, and the upcoming Casey‚Äôs Contraptions).
That‚Äôs a good question. As far as I know there‚Äôs no real ‚Äústandard‚Äù achievement sound (unless you want to rip-off Microsoft).</description>

      <description>Oh boy!
Nothing significant, I just forgot how amusing some of this stuff can be. Taken from 1950‚Äôs PSA called ‚ÄúDuck and Cover‚Äú, via Archive.org.
Then I started playing with clips from the PSA.
Have a good day.</description>

      <title>Trackers and Sequencers rant</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2007/03/25/trackers-and-sequencers-rant/</link>

      <description>Ranting‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. I suppose I‚Äôve been ‚Äúwriting‚Äù music with trackers for about 13 years (Scream, Impulse, Modplug, Buzz, Renoise). Alas, my results have been less than satisfactory. I want to take this moment to apologize to everyone I ever recommended trackers to.
Sorry.
Sometime last month I set out to find a better music app. I‚Äôd already entered the world of VST‚Äôs thanks to Renoise, having put down a big $600 for Colossus.</description>

      <title>An audio workflow with SVN (Rant)</title>
      <link>https://new.toonormal.com/2006/08/22/an-audio-workflow-with-svn-rant/</link>

      <description>I‚Äôve got workflow on the brain, and a discussion about backups on IG got the brain juices flowing. The post is of similar quality and length to what I‚Äôd normally constitute a ‚Äúblog post‚Äù, so I‚Äôm dropping it here so I don‚Äôt forget. It‚Äôs certainly not a surefire answer to anything, just a stroll through me solving a problem.
The set up: SVN, a great tool for backups, versioning, and synchronization, can and should be used in all aspects of development.</description>
