      <title>Using LetsEncrypt with OpenLiteSpeed on Ubuntu</title>

      <description>These notes are based on this.
Install GIT and BC.
Get the latest version of LetsEncrypt using GIT, placing it in /opt/.
For the next step, we‚Äôre going to need access to Port 80, so temporarily shut down your webserver.
Run LetsEncrypt.
The first time this runs, it‚Äôs going to ask for an e-mail address.
If everything worked correctly, you‚Äôll find your certificate files here:

      <title>Research: Value Oscilloscopes</title>

      <description>So basically, this entire series of tool research posts is the result of me searching for an Oscilloscope, and then discovering my existing workflow was bad.
I‚Äôve lost count at how many hours I‚Äôve spent doing homework on low cost high value scopes. I‚Äôve explored a variety of offerings from Siglent, Rigol, Owon, Uni-T, Hantek, and others, trying to find the best value. I don‚Äôt have the desk space for an old analog scope (which is a way to get a good scope for under $100).</description>

      <description>Researching, I learned that China does make some good Soldering Stations, Hot Air Stations, even some good hybrids.
The problem is they assemble them wrong. VERY WRONG! DANGEROUSLY WRONG!
They don‚Äôt always do them wrong, but it‚Äôs best to assume it‚Äôs wrong.
If you‚Äôre up for a challenge, have another iron at your disposal, and are willing to do the homework, you can fix your cheap Chinese Iron. Replacement parts are extremely cheap, so even when things do break down, it wont cost you much to keep it going (or replace it outright).</description>

      <description>I dabble with micro-sized computers. Things like this.
The device above is something called the Orange Pi One, a cheap Chinese designed and manufactured board. Costs about $10 + shipping (~$4 to Canada).
Unlike the highly regarded Raspberry Pi Zero, it has a Quad Core ARMv7 CPU (vs. a single core ARMv6, slooow), a full sized HDMI, full sized USB, and an Ethernet Jack. Pretty amazing little machine for a tenner.</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2016/01/31/research-value-multimeters-for-micro-electronics/</guid>
      <description>I did a bunch of homework on Multimeters. Here‚Äôs a good beginners guide.
And here‚Äôs a more technical guide to buying a good meter.
There‚Äôs a ton of great information packed in that video, but unfortunately dude is an experienced no-compromise electrical engineer, so his minimum recommendations cost around $100. And actually, his advice is correct if you have any interest in doing any real electronics work (Cars, AC devices, or really anything more than microcontrollers).</description>

      <title>Using a PICkit2 on Linux</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2016/01/26/using-a-pickit2-on-linux/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2016/01/26/using-a-pickit2-on-linux/</guid>
      <description>Summary.
The PICkit connector is 6 pins, but the last pin is the Auxiliary pin.
This pin doesn‚Äôt seem to be used that often. The setup could be simplified by snipping the 6th pin.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1897710270/digirule-the-interactive-binary-ruler/posts/1444571
http://www.bradsprojects.com/the-digirule/
After looking in to it, it seems the PICkit 2 is discontinued.
http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV164121
There isn‚Äôt even a download link there for the software.
I found the source code a rather backwards way. The link is here:</description>

      <title>Connecting to devices via a Serial USB cable</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2015/11/25/connecting-to-devices-via-a-serial-usb-cable/</guid>
      <description>Short set of notes.
The most reliable way I‚Äôve found to connect to a remote device is to open a connection immediately after connecting the USB cable to the PC.
At this time, I haven‚Äôt figured out a clean way to disconnect and reconnect without physically unplugging. Closing the screen session (ESC-&amp;gt;CTRL+A-&amp;gt;SHIFT+D-&amp;gt;SHIFT+D) makes follow-up connections via the same line unreliable.
EDIT: This should work: http://askubuntu.com/a/661/364657
Connections require the Black GND (Ground), White TX (Transmit), Green RX (Receieve) pins connected.</description>

NOTE: AfterNET is adding a wildcard SSL certificate. This may obsolete these instructions.
1. Download the certificate.
2. Create a folder afternet.org under /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
3. Copy afternet.cer to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/afternet.org/
4. Symlink it as 90511bdb.0
5. run update-ca-certificates to update the certificates list.
6. Open x-chat.
7. Edit your AfterNET entry.
8. Remove all the old servers and instead add.
9. Check both Use SSL for all Servers on this Network and Accept invalid SSL certificate.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a side project, I‚Äôm using cheap server from these guys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://buyvm.net/&#34;&gt;http://buyvm.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve decided that since it‚Äôs for development, I‚Äôd rather use Apache instead of NgineX. NgineX is much better than Apache when it comes to memory usage and performance, but Apache is a little easier to organize thanks to &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; files. And since Ludum Dare runs and will continue to run Apache for a while, I‚Äôve decided to make my life working on both projects a little simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my reference, the following are my setup notes for the server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Git Notes on SSH Keys</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2015/07/03/git-notes-on-ssh-keys/</guid>
      <description>Dealing with SSH keys is confusing. Every machine you run should have a unique SSH key.
SSH keys typically consist of 2 files:
 id_rsa ‚Äì Your Private Key. Used ONLY on your local machine. id_rsa.pub ‚Äì Your Public Key. Give it to others (pub for public).  NEVER SHARE THE PRIVATE KEY!
The names themselves don‚Äôt matter, so feel free to rename them. It‚Äôs what the files contain that‚Äôs important.</description>

Merging 2 repositories in to one with full history In my case, the local repository (source) was project-a, and the public repository (destination) was project-b.
When I was finished merging, instead of git push -u I had to push it like so:

      <description>Hello 2015. The laptop I‚Äôve been using the past few years actually fell apart, so I bought a new one. I started using Linux (Ubuntu) almost exactly 1 year ago, and as much as I like it, it‚Äôs not always the most logical and obvious OS to use, so I take notes. Here are notes.
The machine is a Lenovo X230 Tablet. It‚Äôs actually an older laptop, a 2013 model, but to put things mildly 2014 was NOT a good year for Lenovo Thinkpads.</description>

In any situation where your user interface presents a popup dialog, that process of presenting the dialog should be a function call. Here is pseudocode:
The general idea here is that there should be 2 ways to use the function: 1.</description>

      <description>Just a short one.
Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4548702/whats-the-equivalent-of-cpp-dd-for-clang
Gives you list of all symbols defined by compilers. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, that you have to feed it something (anything blank) to get this output though. /dev/null, or pipe in a blank echo (echo &amp;quot;&amp;rdquo; | gcc -dM -E -), etc.
Works with NaCl (pnacl-clang), Emscripten (emcc), and pretty much every GCC toolchain known to man.</description>

      <description>Some notes on getting NaCl working. Of course, things didn‚Äôt work out-of-the box.
Install nacl_sdk Grab and follow the instructions here:
https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/download
i.e. download and do the following:
Install 32bit Headers ‚Äòcmon, everybody runs 64bit Linux these days (in my case Ubuntu 14.04 64bit). You need the 32bit libraries for anything to build though.
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23661718/native-client-tutorial-cant-find-libstdc
Follow Tutorial ‚Äòmake serve‚Äô will now work.
https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/devguide/tutorial/tutorial-part1
Test2 probably wont run though. I haven‚Äôt checked, but I think it may not be a pnacl file (pnacl is necessary to run in a stock Chrome).</description>

      <description>So I was having troubles opening a VPN connection from Ubuntu 14.04. I could VPN just fine on my iPad and Android devices, but I was having no luck on Ubuntu. Looking at my /var/log/syslog, and after much Googling, it seems my problem was ‚Äòsecrets‚Äô/keyring related.
Setting up a PPTP VPN connection is easy.

What I was lacking was one very specific checkbox with many implications, none of which were spelled out.</description>

      <description>So I‚Äôve been working on netcode recently. LAN/Local testing is only so effective, when the real internet is so laggy. Ideally, if I could be in 2 places at once, I could test the game under a more natural lagged internet.
So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôve split in two and sent my other half down south‚Ä¶ okay no. I recently set up an inexpensive unmanaged BuyVM VPS server (256 MB RAM, Dual Core) in Las Vegas running a trimmed down version of Ubuntu 14.</description>

I‚Äôve specifically been waiting for a deal on the Samsung Chromebook, as it‚Äôs quite unique: It has a Samsung Exynos SOC, which contains ARM CPU and GPU (MALI-T604). Next to NVidia‚Äôs efforts, these are some of the most powerful ARM CPUs out there. The GPU is a tiny bit dated though (same one as the original Google Nexus 10), but does support OpenGL ES 3.</description>

Corel acquired it between versions 9 and 10, and after 10 it was never the same. Paint Shop Pro used to be an exciting image editor that uniquely combined Raster and Vector image editor together. The killer feature would have been support for importing and exporting vector artwork as vector files (you could import vector as raster, but not vector), but alas, after the Corel acquisition, vector got ignored (Can‚Äôt compete with Corel Draw after all, that piece of sh**).</description>

      <description>Linux notes again!!?!
Yes, as it turns out I decided to replace my dead workstation PC (with beefy specs like Water Cooled Quad Core CPU, NVidia GPUs, RAID Array, etc) with a teeny tiny PC slightly larger than a stack of coasters: A Brix BXi3.

I tried using an older NVidia ION powered Nettop, but that machine really didn‚Äôt work well with Ubuntu 14.04 (The Window Manager at least). I‚Äôm told other WMs are fine, but I‚Äôd rather install a Server disto on a lacking machine like that.</description>

      <description>PerfHud ES is the best OpenGL ES debugger I‚Äôve used, but it can be a bit tricky to set up. And now that I‚Äôm on Linux, even more so.

The latest PerfHud ES is now part of the Tegra Android Development Pack (2.2 as of this writing). An older version is available standalone (2.1), but the latest is now part of the pack.</description>

/2013/12/29/linux-setup-notes/
Well that post is extremely long now, and I accidentally had to reinstall it (video driver fight), so it‚Äôs time for a fresh post!
I had some complaints about Ubuntu 13.10, so I decided to go ahead and install the Alpha version of Ubuntu 14.4 (2 months before release).</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2014/01/25/c-typeof-vs-decltype/</guid>
      <description>GCC and compatible (Clang) compilers implement a feature known as typeof (or __typeof__).
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Typeof.html
This is a pre C++11 feature, omitted from the standard, and is unavailable Visual C++.
For the most part it does what you‚Äôd expect. Given a variable, it returns the type. This lets you create another instance of a type without having to use its full name. This is helpful if you happen to be using templates.</description>

      <title>4K, HDMI, and Deep Color</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2014/01/10/4k-hdmi-and-deep-color/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2014/01/10/4k-hdmi-and-deep-color/</guid>
      <description>As of this writing (January 2014), there are 2 HDMI specifications that support 4K Video (3840√ó2160 16:9). HDMI 1.4 and HDMI 2.0. As far as I know, there are currently no HDMI 2.0 capable TVs available in the market (though many were announced at CES this week).
A detail that tends to be neglected in all this 4K buzz is the Chroma Subsampling. If you‚Äôve ever compared an HDMI signal against something else (DVI, VGA), and the quality looked worse, one of the reasons is because of Chroma Subsampling (for the other reason, see xvYCC at the bottom of this post).</description>

      <description>I can use the following to list all attached USB devices.
The output will be something like the following.
Take note of Device 009, i.e. ‚ÄúMicrosoft Corp.‚Äù. Thats an Xbox One controller plugged in to a USB port.
(Also FYI, the device known as ‚ÄúLogic3‚Äù is a RockCandy brand Xbox 360 controller)
I can retrieve some data about the controller as follows:
Bus 001, Device 009.
It is not controller data though.</description>

      <description>Time to start the year right. After much folley and a good chunk of contract work last year, I started working on a new project. Some of the early-most efforts can be seen in the Quack tech demo video. No gameplay to see there, but you can see one of my prouder achievements in action: Live Coding/Live Content. Change a source file or an asset, and it updates in game immediately.</description>

      <description>Well, more things I‚Äôm expecting to work but don‚Äôt.
 Can‚Äôt Full-Screen a Flash Video, and multitask (the video de-full-screens upon click) With multiple monitors, full-screening flash gets confused (doesn‚Äôt fill full screen) Clicking an App Icon on Ubuntu doesn‚Äôt minimize (by design, but it‚Äôs stupid) In some parts of Ubuntu, the Backspace key acts like a back key. In other places, it does not. CTRL+Insert, SHIFT+Delete, SHIFT+Insert are not Copy, Cut, Pastes.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So whoa, I decided to do something outlandish: I switched my primary laptop to Ubuntu Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some setup notes (mainly for my own reference). My Laptop is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X220&#34;&gt;Lenovo X220&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I was able to get Ubuntu to boot correctly, I had to change my BIOS from ‚Äúboth Legacy and UEFI‚Äù mode to just ‚ÄúUEFI Mode‚Äù. To bring up the BIOS menu you press the blue ThinkVantage button. This setting can be found on the startup (?) page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-remapping&#34;&gt;Key Remapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lenovo X220 has Web Forward/Back keys beside the arrow keys. I prefer that they act like alternative PageUp and PageDown keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;strong&gt;/usr/share/X11/symbols/inet&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. sudo gedit /usr/share/X11/symbols/inet)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a key named &lt;strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Change ‚ÄúXF86Back‚Äù to ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Prior&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äú.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browse to &lt;strong&gt;/var/lib/xkb/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delete *&lt;strong&gt;.xkm&lt;/strong&gt; in the /var/lib/xkb folder. You &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to do this to force a keyboard code refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logout, then Login to refresh. (Or reboot)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mesa 10.0 was released in December 2013 (now Mesa 10.1), which introduces OpenGL 3.3 support. Ubuntu 13.10 came out back in October (i.e. 2013-10), so it lacks this update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?50038-Updated-and-Optimized-Ubuntu-Free-Graphics-Drivers&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The current MESA drivers (10.0.2) only support OpenGL 3.0 on the Intel HD 3000 (where as Windows supports OpenGL 3.1, plus many 3.2 and 3.3 extensions). Newer Intel GPUs (the HD 4000 and the HD 2500) should support up to OpenGL 3.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The Intel HD 3000 does not support OpenCL. Newer Intel GPUs do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recovery-mode&#34;&gt;Recovery Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially while playing video drivers, if you screw something up, you can &lt;strong&gt;hold SHIFT&lt;/strong&gt; during boot to bring up the GRUB menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start a &lt;strong&gt;Recovery Console&lt;/strong&gt; (which is by default in Read Only mode) and do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the 64bit Linux ‚ÄòBundle‚Äô file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions borrowed from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webupd8.org/2012/06/how-to-install-vmware-player-in-ubuntu.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow instructions. Fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attach a DVD drive, and insert a Windows 7 CD (NOT a restore CD). Create a VM. Adjust settings accordingly (half your RAM, equal number of CPU cores, ~60 GB of space).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support Intel GPU drivers, open up the ‚Äú???.vmx‚Äù file (where ??? is your VM name). Add the following line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; VMWare Player 6.0.1 only supports OpenGL 2.1 on Windows 7 (i.e. on par with OpenGL ES 2.0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disable-touchpad&#34;&gt;Disable Touchpad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a Lenovo laptop for a reason: It has a nub-mouse (joystick). I prefer this to touchpads. However, by default both input methods attempt to work at the same time. This can cause weird glitches, like random copy/pasting or focus loss. An easy fix is to just outright disable the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to &lt;a href=&#34;http://embraceubuntu.com/2006/12/21/fix-firefox-backspace-to-take-you-to-the-previous-page/&#34;&gt;some sillyness&lt;/a&gt;, it was decided that backspace on Linux should do nothing. For the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù use, as a ‚ÄúPage Back‚Äù button, make the following tweak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place files in &lt;strong&gt;~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/&lt;/strong&gt; that you want to make available from the right click menu. If a shell script, be sure to set it Executable (chmod +x). Also feel free to ignore adding a ‚Äú.sh‚Äù file extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful Script: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/10/enable-open-as-administrator-ubuntu-13-10-nautilus/&#34;&gt;Run as Root&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-player&#34;&gt;Music Player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;Audacious&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Track can be found under the Speaker Icon in the Panel (I wish there was a track/name up there). A preinstalled plugin AOSD can be enabled for a ‚ÄúCurrent Track‚Äù popup, whenever the song changes. There‚Äôs another plugin which enables media keys (FN+Arrows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;image-editing&#34;&gt;Image Editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;GIMP&lt;/strong&gt;. For reals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run it. Go to the &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; menu and click &lt;strong&gt;Single-Window Mode&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, it‚Äôs 100x more tollerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNG files are exported, not saved (unlike Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calculator&#34;&gt;Calculator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;SpeedCrunch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gdebugger&#34;&gt;gDEBugger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn‚Äôt actually work, but‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gremedy.com/downloadLinux.php&#34;&gt;Download it&lt;/a&gt;. Unzip it to /opt/gDEBugger/ (or some other nice folder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a symlink so gDEBugger can find the 64bit GL libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;strong&gt;/opt/gDEBugger/gDEBugger&lt;/strong&gt; to start it. NOTE: gDEBugger-bin wont run directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More OpenGL &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Debugging_Tools&#34;&gt;debug tools are here&lt;/a&gt; (glslDevil?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;codexl-openglopencl-debugger&#34;&gt;CodeXL (OpenGL/OpenCL Debugger)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems easy to install, but &lt;strong&gt;REQUIRES&lt;/strong&gt; an OpenCL capable GPU. Sorry Intel HD 3000. üôÅ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apitrace-opengl-command-logger-and-post-run-trace-tools&#34;&gt;APITrace (OpenGL command logger and post-run trace tools)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this is the only Linux GPU debugger worth a damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Solved. Ignore everything below. To get audio playback working correctly in Audacity (and not silly weird glitch fast), simply select the ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Samson GoMic: USB Audio (hw:1,0)&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù for output, instead of one of the many defaults. Fixed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: This is incorrect. A good try though. Problem is the Samson Go Mic that I‚Äôm using as an audio interface. Audacity works fine with the internal sound card (which has a horrible mic). Oddly though, recording via the Samson appears to work though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dangers-of-the-oibaf-drivers&#34;&gt;The Dangers of the OIBAF drivers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/graphics-drivers&#34;&gt;OIBAF MESA drivers&lt;/a&gt; are great. Bleeding edge Linux graphics drivers, with the very latest supported OpenGL features (GL 3.0 on my Intel HD 3000 GPU). We‚Äôre in a transition period though. Mesa just reached a very important milestone, several months after Ubuntu 13.10‚Äôs release: OpenGL 3.x support (i.e. Mesa 10.x). The upcoming Ubuntu 14.4 will ship with these new Mesa drivers, but gosh darnit, I‚Äôm doing serious GL shader development, and I need them now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first installed them, everything was great. According to &lt;strong&gt;/var/log/apt/history.log&lt;/strong&gt;, my version of OIBAF was from January 10th, 2014. A few days ago I upgraded to the very latest, and that broke both &lt;strong&gt;Chrome&lt;/strong&gt; and more importantly &lt;strong&gt;VMware&lt;/strong&gt;. My game stuff unusually is working fine with the new drivers, but the current drivers from today are busted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I need to do: Uninstall OIBAF, then reinstall an older version of OIBAF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uninstalling-a-ppa-oibaf&#34;&gt;Uninstalling a PPA (OIBAF)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First install PPA Purge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then use it to purge the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I‚Äôd recommend a reboot, but Logging out and in *may* work (I can‚Äôt remember).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-oibaf&#34;&gt;Installing OIBAF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is easy. I‚Äôd suggest checking your Mesa version first (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the 2nd line is just &lt;strong&gt;upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;, not &lt;strong&gt;dist-upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;. Both functions do the same thing, but if I understand correctly, &lt;strong&gt;upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; doesn‚Äôt uninstall obsolete packages, while &lt;strong&gt;dist-upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; does. So &lt;strong&gt;dist-upgrade&lt;/strong&gt; is the smart one. This means that downgrading to Mesa 9.2 (as I had to do) required a full re-download of Mesa 9.2, as it was already removed from my machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-apt-cache&#34;&gt;The Apt Cache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/var/cache/apt/archives/&lt;/strong&gt; contains cached copies of packages you‚Äôve downloaded. I lucked out, finding my January 10th version of the OIBAF drivers here, so there may still be some hope to downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To list all installed packages, do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extremely long list that omits version numbers. If you know roughly what the package you want is named, you can include the first part of the name like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, this is really only useful if you know what a package is named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To search the package database for something, use search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also includes descriptions of packages, which can be extremely helpful for discovering exactly what package you‚Äôre looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get information about a package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way, with a slightly different output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List just the install options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, whodathunk. ‚ÄúMadison‚Äù ‚Äòeh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;oibaf-adventures&#34;&gt;OIBAF Adventures&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>According to the documentation, SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION was primarily used to tell SDL which method to use to construct the Window on desktop Open. OpenGL 3.x introduces a new way of context creation, so this would have been used to suggest which way to create (old way or new way). Of course, Mobile needed a way to handle ES 1.1 vs ES 2.0 (and sort-of ES 3.0 too, but so far the ES 3.</description>

      <description>By correct, I mean the way that will work across multiple devices, and give you OpenGL (ES) shaders.
If you don‚Äôt need shaders (i.e. OpenGL 1.x, OpenGL ES 1.1), a lone SDL_Init will suffice (default behavior).
If you are using SDL_GL_LoadLibrary, you *MUST* put the calls in the following order.
I had to do it this way (between these 2 calls), otherwise Android devices with PowerVR GPUs would not work (Nexus S, Intel powered devices, Kindle Fire?</description>

      <description>Phew! Okay, my little science experiment from today (i.e. why I needed a makefile): SquirrelyJS.

SquirrelyJS is a Squirrel Programming Language compiler and VM running in the browser. So it‚Äôs a bunch of JavaScript code, a bunch of C/C++ code compiled using Emscripten, all wired up to a shittyweb page.
It‚Äôs barebones at the moment. You can edit/change/replace the code in the left side, and hit the Compile buttons to recompile it.</description>

      <description>This seems to happen a lot for me. I‚Äôm testing/playing around with some code thing, and I set up some cheeseball compiling in a shell script. Then I get to a point and it‚Äôs just not enough, the compiling is taking too long, or so one. My major projects often have a nice makefile setup going, but my experiments, not so much. That‚Äôs because writing a makefile, despite being the same thing again and again for me, is tricky to get right.</description>

      <description>So last year, Derek and I created a little game called Nook. Nook was an interesting game that was half JavaScript and half C++, running in the browser (as 100% JavaScript). Things were still new with Emscripten. At the time it had only recently reached the point where it could work with standard C++ libraries without issue. Performance claims were about 6x slower than native. Everything worked out great, so I did little writeup on it:</description>

      <title>Evaluating JavaScript to Native-App Packagers</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2013/05/07/evaluating-javascript-to-native-app-packagers/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2013/05/07/evaluating-javascript-to-native-app-packagers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;EDIT: For reference I‚Äôm leaving this post as-is (except for the new ending), but it seems AppJS is a lot more painful to use after all. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I need to write a tool with a UI. I want it to be portable, just in case. And because JavaScript is ‚Äúfine‚Äù, I‚Äôm investigating what packaging options there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not doing a very scientific test. All I‚Äôm doing is throwing TOOM, an adventure game Derek Laufman and I made for Ludum Dare 26 at it. If it works, I‚Äôm happy. If it fails, I‚Äôm not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOOM uses SoundJS and PreloadJS. PreloadJS wont work if the browser is reading from the local file system (i.e. file:///blah.html). So developing TOOM, I‚Äôve had to use a tiny webserver running locally (currently &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/&#34;&gt;Mongoose&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=&#34;http://sourceforge.net/projects/miniweb/&#34;&gt;MiniWeb&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chrome-packaged-apps&#34;&gt;Chrome Packaged Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the name, despite the wording, this doesn‚Äôt create standalone apps. It creates content for distribution by Google‚Äôs Chrome App Store only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also not officially live yet. You can make apps, test them, but can‚Äôt Publish. Beh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;node-webkit&#34;&gt;Node-Webkit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit&#34;&gt;https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good simple solution, based on NodeJS and Chromium, regularly updated (Intel Sponsored), but fails the TOOM test. It starts loading, but dies at an unusual place (complaining about one of my source files missing‚Ä¶ which is definitely there if it can start loading at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adds about &lt;strong&gt;54 MB&lt;/strong&gt; to the total size (~23 MB zipped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;appjs&#34;&gt;AppJS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://appjs.org/&#34;&gt;http://appjs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fantastic solution, also based on NodeJS and Chromium, and so far the only thing to pass the TOOM test (no audio and slower, so clearly using an older version of Chromium). The very very saddening part however is that there‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/appjs-dev/IWRN8FaAheU&#34;&gt;only 1 guy on the project&lt;/a&gt;, and he‚Äôs too busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also adds about &lt;strong&gt;54 MB&lt;/strong&gt; to the total size (~22 MB zipped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-2012&#34;&gt;Visual Studio 2012&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng#downloads&#34;&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng#downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untested, but this option is Windows only, and there may be other caveats. Any code written for DiskIO and file manipulation will only work on Windows. No WebGL support. That said, the JS code may compile down to CLI bytecodes (dot net), so performance might be better. Also how an app is structured may not mirror how a web project is created (index.html and all files). Untested though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adobe-air&#34;&gt;Adobe Air&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html&#34;&gt;http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Created my &lt;a href=&#34;http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118666ade46-7ff1.html&#34;&gt;descriptor file&lt;/a&gt;, modified it to use the HTML file, then ran it with adl (adl D:\Toom\application.xml). After fixing the one bug it reported, it just sits there‚Ä¶ waiting. Running I assume, but there‚Äôs no action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Instructions for running and packaging I found inside ‚ÄúAIR SDK Readme.txt‚Äù in AirSDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tidesdk&#34;&gt;TideSDK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tidesdk.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.tidesdk.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as Appcelerator Titanium for Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, another one that passes the TOOM test. TideSDK is based on Webkit, but a seemingly an older version of webkit. CSS Fonts did not work, the framerate was even slower than AppJS, and no audio. Still, it was interesting. Downside is they seem to be short on funds too; Their blog reminds me of PBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-choices-no-good-ones&#34;&gt;More choices, no good ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11015811/html5-desktop-wrapper-framework&#34;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11015811/html5-desktop-wrapper-framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no safe/good/active choice, but AppJS impressed me the most. As far as portability goes, I think what I want to be using is something that combines Chrome and NodeJS, but not Webkit. Plus it gives me a reason to learn NodeJS too. My Browser performance and debugging experience is just so much better with Chrome, even though I don‚Äôt use it as a primary browser (I use Firefox instead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrettably AppJS right now today is a bit of a gamble, since it‚Äôs just one dude behind it, and he‚Äôs made it clear he doesn‚Äôt have the time. But it does exactly what I want, so *shrug*. There‚Äôs talk of a Kickstarter, and I hope this sees the light of day. Totally a worthwhile project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-twist&#34;&gt;PLOT TWIST!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a good one though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I hadn‚Äôt really realized before was how AppJS is actually working. From what I can tell, it‚Äôs actually running a small web server, i.e. the NodeJS part. Your main JS script file is standalone and disconnected from what runs in the browser context‚Ä¶ YET, you control maximizing/minimizing windows, the contents of menus, task bar appearance from the NodeJS side. Your app is standalaone, caged inside the browser context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there may be a way to pass data between the NodeJS side and Chromium side, similar to making web requests in general. It‚Äôs not documented though, so *sigh* not sure where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node-Webkit might actually be more of what I want, since it‚Äôs about introducing the Node features in to Webkit. That said, it failed the TOOM test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well, enough of this for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>So I‚Äôm typically a native C/C++ programmer, and I seem to surprise people when I say I like JavaScript yet dislike C# and Java. What I like about JavaScript is that it does things C and C++ don‚Äôt, as opposed to C# and Java that take C++ and as a base and enforce new constraints to ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù code. Both C# and Java do improve on C++, but I find the new strictness they impose to be a detriment or intermediary fix.</description>

I‚Äôm typically a ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù, ‚Äúnative code is best‚Äù, ‚Äúc++ FTW‚Äù type of developer. The thing is, developers with my skillset and experience really are at a big disadvantage in today‚Äôs game market.</description>

      <title>MinGW Library Building Notes (POCO)</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2012/12/05/mingw-library-building-notes-poco/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 06:09:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2012/12/05/mingw-library-building-notes-poco/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been evaluating some new libraries lately and as usual, I decided to take some notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;poco&#34;&gt;POCO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pocoproject.org/&#34;&gt;POCO&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a nice complete C++ library filled with things that other languages like Python and Java have. It‚Äôs very feature filled, but it‚Äôs unfortunately obvious that the development team doesn‚Äôt spend much time working or testing on Windows (and when they do, it‚Äôs with MSVC). There is a MinGW build, but as of &lt;strong&gt;POCO 1.4.5&lt;/strong&gt; it‚Äôs designed for Cygwin MinGW, which is a variation of MinGW that you invoke with ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;-mno-cygwin&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù to remove dependence on the Cygwin libraries. No good for a pure &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mingw.org&#34;&gt;MinGW+MSys&lt;/a&gt; user like myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I had to make the following changes to &lt;strong&gt;build/config/MinGW&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to actually compile and use exchndl.dll (DrMinGW)</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2012/12/02/how-to-actually-compile-and-use-exchndl-dll-drmingw/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2012 15:00:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2012/12/02/how-to-actually-compile-and-use-exchndl-dll-drmingw/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DrMinGW is a fancy crash detection program for MinGW programs. Details can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/DrMingw&#34;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/DrMingw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the really cool features of DrMinGW is you can alternatively invoke a DLL from your program to catch your crashes, instead of requiring you or your testers to install DrMinGW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is the library and DLL aren‚Äôt available for download, and building it from sources requires SCONS, which I can‚Äôt seem to get to work with it. So, my solution is to build it manually. Unfortunately, building it requires knowledge of some of the secret defines set by SCONS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GCC, MSYS, MinTTY, PDCurses, WinPTY, and good times in the shell</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2012/11/17/gcc-msys-mintty-pdcurses-winpty-and-good-times-in-the-shell/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a strange developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preferred development environment is &lt;a href=&#34;http://gcc.gnu.org&#34;&gt;GCC&lt;/a&gt; running in a simulated BASH shell on Windows. This madness all started well over a decade ago when I first discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/&#34;&gt;DJGPP&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://gcc.gnu.org&#34;&gt;GCC&lt;/a&gt; for DOS. This means GCC was my first C and C++ compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now sure, like most kids (?!) I used Visual C++ in College. That was mainly for my school projects though. Whenever it was me time, I was rocking the DJGPP. To be honest, I can‚Äôt really remember when I switched away from DJGPP, but I‚Äôm fairly certain I was still using it in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;End of 1999 I was hired by long forgotten game developer Sandbox Studios as a GameBoy programmer. I had been dabbling with the GameBoy homebrew during the summer of 1999, made some little games, and won some stuff in a contest (Flashcarts). This lead to me using a GameBoy assembler called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.otakunozoku.com/rednex-gameboy-development-system/&#34;&gt;RGBDS&lt;/a&gt; (Rednex GameBoy Development Suite), which was a great little macro assembler suite. All command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point: I‚Äôve been comfortably working in command lines and shells for a long time. And I do it on Windows, where everybody else uses Visual Studio. I treat my Windows as a Linux box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past decade, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cygwin.com&#34;&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mingw.org&#34;&gt;MinGW/MSYS&lt;/a&gt; have been the go-to ways of working Linux‚Äôy on Windows. I used to use a lot of Cygwin, especially since all the major video game console toolchains of the time were GCC based, and Cygwin did a much better job at simulating/hosting/building a GCC cross compiler. GameBoy Advance, PlayStation, though there were some alternatives (SN, CodeWarrior), in my books GCC was the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I rarely use Cygwin, but I always keep it around. Instead I use MinGW, which is a GCC port with a mostly compatible set of Win32 libraries, and MSYS (a minimal Bash/Cygwin like environment). It‚Äôs had its rough moments over the years, but for my needs I find it to be the better of the two. Cygwin‚Äôs goals are to simulate Unix on Windows. MinGW/MSYS‚Äôs goals are to target Windows with GCC. Why half-ass it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>C&#43;&#43;11 Compiler Support Wishlist</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2012/11/12/c11-compiler-support-wishlist/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 11:41:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2012/11/12/c11-compiler-support-wishlist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months back I did this little investigation in to &lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/2012/08/25/practical-c11-support-for-game-developers/&#34;&gt;C++11 support across compilers&lt;/a&gt;. The goal here was to figure out what C++11 features I could safely use today. I also ended up creating a useful list of compiler versions sorted by platform. I will continue, at least for the near term, updating this list as I see changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is a follow up to that. I‚Äôm more familiar now with the actual use of many of these ‚Äònextgen‚Äô features, so this post is a brief on certain features I really want to use, and why I can or can not use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Safe C&#43;&#43; Pointers to Member Functions (Functors)</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2012/11/11/safe-c-pointers-to-member-functions/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2012 18:35:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2012/11/11/safe-c-pointers-to-member-functions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did a post some time ago on a threading library called &lt;strong&gt;TinyThread++&lt;/strong&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/2012/09/21/cross-platform-c-threading-today/&#34;&gt;find it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like always, the following is just a collection of notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item 1: &lt;strong&gt;TinyThread++&lt;/strong&gt; is an almost functionally equivalent alternative to C++11 threads, but instead of taking multiple arguments to the thread it takes a single void*. When C++11 support improves everywhere, that will be the time to switch. But in the meantime, a void* is a good compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item 2: Whenever I describe how and why a member function is different than a global/static function, I often say that a member function has a ‚Äúsecret 1st argument, the ‚Äòthis‚Äô pointer‚Äù. Heck, if I was going to build a C++ compiler, I would implement it like this. So for the longest time I just assumed this is how others implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is true, then it should be possible to convert a member function in to a ‚Äúvoid Func(void*)‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, this behavior is forbidden by the C++ standard. That said, it works in &lt;strong&gt;GCC&lt;/strong&gt;, but fails in &lt;strong&gt;MSVC&lt;/strong&gt;. In GCC‚Äôs case, while it does work, it invokes a warning known as ‚Äúpmf-conversions‚Äù. You can explicitly disable the warning with ‚Äú-Wno-pmf-conversions‚Äù, but given that this just doesn‚Äôt work in Visual Studio it‚Äôs probably unwise to do in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nice solution was to add a static proxy function that takes a single ‚Äúthis class‚Äù pointer, and call the function as if it was a member of the class (because it is).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>So hey. I wrote and open sourced a small cross platform library for getting the IP and MAC address of the current device. You can find it here:
https://github.com/povrazor/net-adapter
So far I‚Äôve tested it on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and Mac OSX Mountain Lion. It *should* also work on iOS, BSD and Android. If you happen to test it on one of those other platforms, I would love to know what the Sample program outputs.</description>

      <description>So I‚Äôve done a bunch of networking research lately, and have actually decided I‚Äôm not going to continue writing my own HTTP GETter and POSTer. Instead, I‚Äôll be using libcurl. That said, I am not that comfortable using 3rd party libraries and tools unless I have a solid understanding of how they work internally.
So this is a collection of notes on how to do HTTP GET and POST requests, in case I ever need to come back and do this from scratch (because I‚Äôm not going to remember all this).</description>

      <title>Cross Platform C&#43;&#43; Threading Today</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2012/09/21/cross-platform-c-threading-today/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2012 00:35:26 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2012/09/21/cross-platform-c-threading-today/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;C++11 finally brings threading in to the core C++ language. Unfortunately, as my &lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/2012/08/25/practical-c11-support-for-game-developers/&#34;&gt;little investigation found&lt;/a&gt;, we‚Äôre not quite all there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs okay though, ‚Äôcause as it turns out, most of core function of C++ threading can be emulated using standard C and C++ features. While doing something else, I stumbled upon a library &lt;strong&gt;TinyThread++&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs lightweight (2+1 source files), cross platform, and free+open source in the best ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tinythreadpp.bitsnbites.eu/&#34;&gt;http://tinythreadpp.bitsnbites.eu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TinyThread++&lt;/strong&gt; attempts to emulate the usage of standard C++11 threading, in a decent, good enough, compromise way. I like it, so instead of fooling around with pThreads and whatever classic Microsoft APIs do, I‚Äôm going to use it. And since it‚Äôs so simple (2+1 files), if I need something or need to fix something, it‚Äôs right there. Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, there is an equivalent C variant: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinycthread.bitsnbites.eu/&#34;&gt;http://tinycthread.bitsnbites.eu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a living collection of notes I‚Äôve taken whilst exploring Windows 8 development. It‚Äôs not guaranteed to be well written nor complete, but who knows, maybe it‚Äôll be useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>So it‚Äôs Ludum Dare 24 weekend (Aug 24th), and I‚Äôm finally catching up on some work I had to put off as I ‚Ä¶ ahem ‚Ä¶ attended to my duties. Now that the event is going strong, it‚Äôs reading time!
The main thing I need to do is some Windows 8 research. I installed the Windows 8 RTM (release) Trial on a new machine earlier this week, as well as the Visual Studio 2012 Express.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I run an online game-jam event called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ludum Dare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and this past weekend I got together with a friend (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/laufman&#34;&gt;Derek Laufman&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.halfbot.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halfbot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and we made a game. What did we make? A platformer about size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was created over a period 72 hours. Somehow, amazing to me, we managed to pull it together despite our responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me running the event (Ludum Dare)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family gathering at my brothers I attended on the Saturday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Car appointment on Monday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derek taking care of his baby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, running Ludum Dare is only busy for me before the event, and at submission time (two of them, 3-5 hours each). During the event I‚Äôm free to sit down and do whatever I want. This weekend was the &lt;strong&gt;Diablo 3 beta test&lt;/strong&gt;, and if I was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markfassett.com&#34;&gt;lesser man&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôd have played that. Fortunately for me, Derek came to me a couple weeks ago and suggested we make a game together, I said yes, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs totally silly, but I‚Äôm actually proud of the fact that I managed to attend the family gathering and the car appointment. Stupid me, I could have actually cancelled/rescheduled the appointment for Tuesday or Wednesday, but I decided to go ahead with it anyway. The car appointment was my &lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/2010/04/08/automobiles-interviews-all-smiles/&#34;&gt;yearly service for my smartcar&lt;/a&gt;, and I ended up staying in the neighborhood of the dealership for about 5 hours of that day. Working on my Ludum Dare game on my laptop, I had WIFI at the dealership, and also McDonalds, where I parked myself for a couple hours. To be honest, this was probably the first time I seriously ‚ÄúCoffee Shop Developed‚Äù, and where I actually got some serious work done. It was fun, because it was out of the ordinary. üôÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that‚Äôs enough back story. Lets get nerdy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Better MinGW &#43; MSys Shell</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2011/12/04/a-better-mingwmsys-shell/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2011/12/04/a-better-mingwmsys-shell/</guid>
      <description>Pekka posed a good question recently that got me thinking: The default Bash shell that comes with MinGW (MSys) kinda sucks. You can‚Äôt resize the Window, selections are this odd visible only thing, in essence: it works like an ordinary windows cmd shell.
The solution is surprisingly straight forward: Use MinTTY.
Open up a MinGW shell, and do the following:
 mingw-get install mintty
 A few moments later, you‚Äôll have MinTTY installed.</description>

      <title>BlackBerry PlayBook NDK Command Line Advanced Quickstart Guide</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2011/11/26/blackberry-playbook-ndk-command-line-quickstart-guide/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2011 22:32:08 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2011/11/26/blackberry-playbook-ndk-command-line-quickstart-guide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.galcon.com&#34;&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; keeps telling me I need to document what I do. After all, I‚Äôve worked on a ridiculous number of platforms, and with many SDK‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So alright, I‚Äôm going to record and share my notes here. I‚Äôm going to assume you have your own build system figured out, and cover the highlights and key things you need to know and do to get native code up and running on the PlayBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;device-summary&#34;&gt;Device Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few highlights about the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual Core 1 GHz ARM Coretex-A9 w/ Neon, 7‚Ä≥ 1024√ó600 IPS LCD (drool), PowerVR SGX 540 GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDK Available. Work either through a custom Eclipse IDE, or entirely from the command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command line is a typical GCC cross compiler setup, with custom tools for packaging/deploying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux-like platform. EGL and GLES1/GLES2 available. OpenAL available (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codedojo.com/?p=1439&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlackBerry packages are BAR files, which are actually JAR files, which are actually ZIP files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was on sale for just $199 during the weeks surrounding ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1-request-signing-keys&#34;&gt;Step 1. Request Signing Keys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is step 1 because how long it takes is entirely outside your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.blackberry.com/native/signingkey&#34;&gt;http://developer.blackberry.com/native/signingkey&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys/&#34;&gt;ALT&lt;/a&gt;) and make your request. Typically within a few hours you will get a series of e-mails containing &lt;strong&gt;.csj&lt;/strong&gt; files, so if you‚Äôve previously downloaded the SDK, you‚Äôll be waiting a while before you can test on device. More details &lt;a href=&#34;https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/documentation/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.quickstart/topic/request_code_sign_key.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; REMEMBER YOUR PIN AND COMPANY NAME! YOU WILL NEED IT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For times like these, I like to create a text file containing the signing code, and put it alongside the signing keys. Yes, technically that partially defeats the security purpose of the keys, but keys and signing is usually such-a-pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1b-apply-for-a-blackberry-appworld-vendor-account&#34;&gt;Step 1b. Apply for a Blackberry AppWorld Vendor account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also takes a while, so do this early to get in the queue sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/&#34;&gt;https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will eventually get an email asking for a scan of government issued ID such as a drivers license, or business related documents (to prove you are real). If you have these ready, you can respond to the request quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payments are via Paypal, so you will need a valid Paypal account to be paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-2-get-the-ndk&#34;&gt;Step 2. Get the NDK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah! You can do it! Click them links and go go go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/&#34;&gt;https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the downloader tries to install some Akamai service thingy. I couldn‚Äôt get this working, but that‚Äôs okay. There‚Äôs an option to say ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;this did not work&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù in the popup box, and after the popup closes there‚Äôs an option to download directly without Akamai. Use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Enough of this non-game talk.
The past month has been extremely good for progress. I did not meet my goal for the month, but I‚Äôd be silly to complain. Yadda yadda ya.
Against my better judgement, I‚Äôm going to stop beating around the bush and show you:
 That‚Äôs cool Mike, but what is it?
 Tech.
 Wait Mike, you could have done that in a day using Unity? It would be faster!</description>

      <title>The Synology NAS, two months later</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2011/10/29/the-synology-nas-two-months-later/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2011/10/29/the-synology-nas-two-months-later/</guid>
      <description>NAS time, again! Like before, I‚Äôm collecting my notes and thoughts all in one place.
Two months later As mentioned in my earlier posts, I‚Äôm running both SVN and AppDailySales on it (iTunes Connect Sales Stat grabber). In addition, I‚Äôve been running an internal wiki on it. I used to host 2 different external wikis, but both have been imported and archived locally.
I chose DokuWiki for my internal wiki because it uses flat files, meaning I don‚Äôt have to run SQL (though it is just a button to enable MySQL on the Synology).</description>

      <title>Notes: Exporting .bullet data from Blender 2.5</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2011/10/06/notes-exporting-bullet-data-from-blender-2-5/</link>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2011/10/06/notes-exporting-bullet-data-from-blender-2-5/</guid>
      <description>Here‚Äôs some notes from my internal wiki.
How to export .bullet data from a Blender 2.5x scene (awfully close to 2.6 now ‚Äòeh). This might be as of Blender 2.57, and should continue to work well in to 2.6x.
 Exporting Bullet Data from Blender Exporting Bullet Physics data from Blender is a pain in the ass. Plain and Simple. It *SHOULD* be a right click export, but no, it‚Äôs complicated.</description>

      <title>AppDailySales, and running on Synology NAS Devices</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2011/08/23/appdailysales-and-running-on-synology-nas-devices/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2011 23:59:29 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2011/08/23/appdailysales-and-running-on-synology-nas-devices/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/002.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Continuing &lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/2011/08/23/i-am-running-a-synology-nas-now/&#34;&gt;my prior post&lt;/a&gt; where I talk about my server replacement, a Synology NAS (DS211j). In essence, a cheap, tiny dedicated Linux box featuring an ARM CPU and custom web UI specially designed for SUPER EASY RAID array maintenance and creation. There‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS411j&amp;amp;lang=enu&#34;&gt;a 4 drive version&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/index.php?lang=enu&#34;&gt;many-more drive&lt;/a&gt; versions, but they cost more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I‚Äôm here to talk about a little tool for getting your daily sales data from Apple‚Äôs iTunes Connect website. &lt;strong&gt;AppDailySales&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/&#34;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a python script I was recommended some months back, but it needed a few things IMO. So in a shocking rare case of OSS justice, I added the features I wanted myself and submitted a patch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/issues/detail?id=31&amp;amp;can=1&#34;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/issues/detail?id=31&amp;amp;can=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago (nine months later), version 2.9 was released (sparked by Apple‚Äôs change to the system), now including my patches! üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the script, all you need is Python. Before I used to run this on Windows XP (Python installed in C:\Python2.7, with PATH environment variable set to include this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the NAS, I SSH in to the device (Go download Putty if on Windows), login as root (same password as admin), and install the python package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ipkg install python&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the AppDailySales.py script somewhere on your computer, likely in the same folder you want your stats placed. Then simply invoke it with ‚Äìhelp to get a list of arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python appdailysales.py --help&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run it from a batch file or script. My old Batch File Version looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new, shockingly similar shell script version (i.e. only single %‚Äôs) is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates files like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-13.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-12.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-11.txt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; 2010/2010-12/Daily-2010-12-10.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice and easy to read names, unlike the default files generated by iTunes Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next section, I‚Äôll talk more about setting it up as a service. In other words, totally automated!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/2006/10/07/new-server-aka-i-killed-a-cisco/&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last week, a drive &lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/2006/10/07/new-server-aka-i-killed-a-cisco/&#34;&gt;in my server died&lt;/a&gt;. These drives weren‚Äôt really that old, but were Seagate‚Äôs from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1050374/seagate-barracuda-7200-drives-failing&#34;&gt;drive failing epidemic&lt;/a&gt; a few years back. I bought 6 drives around this time, 4 for the server in a RAID 10 array, 2 for my workstation. I lost 1 to the failure problem, and the rest I managed to get updated firmwares installed in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have been extremely leery of Seagate drives. My server ran Windows XP (yes), and used the on-board Intel SATA RAID controller of this MOBO. On several occasions, the RAID integrity would fail for no good reason upon bootup, that I simply stopped turning my server off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother the ‚Äúprofessional network admin‚Äù has been reminding me for years that Software Linux RAID is the best RAID. So after this tragic failure (no data lost, just some hair), it was time for something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I have been talking NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices for a while, he himself trying a few over the years, to really sub-par results. Generally, the prices were terrible for completely sub par hardware that couldn‚Äôt perform. Popular NAS like the Drobo start at like $700, yuck! The best bang for buck always seemed to be building a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, bang for buck wise, building your own file server is still cheaper. But Linux is a delicate mistress. I am a coder, and dealing with game console development tools and Linux setups over the years has taught me how to live comfortably in Linux. I work on Windows though, just I do it with Cygwin and MinGW/MSys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, there is still too much sh*t to learn about Linux. Time is money. Building and maintaining another server, I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt want to do it (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freenas.org/&#34;&gt;FreeNAS&lt;/a&gt; was suggested on my Twitter, for anyone in a more adventurous mood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs 2011, give me a drop in solution that‚Äôs cheap, small, fast and good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_20110823_214643.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blam!&lt;/strong&gt; Hello &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS211j&amp;amp;lang=enu&#34;&gt;Synology DS211j&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 2 drive consumer model rakes in at around $200, size not much larger than an eternal casing, and sporting a 1.2 GHz ARM processor. ARM! Hey! I know those!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs a breed of Linux, interfaces via gorgeous fast HTML UI, and support fancy Linux favorites like SSH out-of-the-box. Well not quite out-of-the-box, as you do need to download the latest firmware and a setup tool for your OS, but that‚Äôs easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine I filed with a pair of 3TB Hitachi Deskstar drives, spinning at 7200 RPMS with 64 MB of cache. Western Digital Caviar Green drives were $40 cheaper each, but are known to be slow and problematic on RAIDs (though there are fixes, a tool WDidle3 seems to address this). Again, time is da mon-nay, and wanted something I could just drop in. Benchmarks said these drives were better overall performers too, so hey, why not!&lt;/p&gt;

I think I had this done in 5 minutes, max. Didn‚Äôt even need a manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the array I wanted (MODE 1) was extremely straightforward, that I wont both talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I will talk about is some of the advanced stuff I wanted from it, and the configuring done to make it act accordingly. After all, this blog post is actually for me, so I can know what I did in case I need to reproduce it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This past couple weeks I‚Äôve been busily working on architecting many little things (super important things) for my new game. One of the big things I really didn‚Äôt set out to do initially, but once I realized my efforts were converging there, I decided to make it a priority: Live Coding.
I am using a scripting language Squirrel to handle the gameplay side of the programming. This is new for me, having hardcoded or written my own sub-par scripting and data entry dialects to make my prior games.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, I‚Äôve spammed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mikekasprzak&#34;&gt;twitterverse&lt;/a&gt; enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs something I &lt;strong&gt;started&lt;/strong&gt; playing with today, and &lt;strong&gt;finished&lt;/strong&gt; just a few hours later, satisfied. &lt;a href=&#34;http://industriousone.com/premake&#34;&gt;Premake&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, it‚Äôs a build script and project file maker, just like CMake and Scons. It uses Lua scripting, to contrast custom and python for the others (CMake a Scons respectfully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren‚Äôt me, you could save yourself a slew of portability headaches with this simple script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(From &lt;a href=&#34;http://industriousone.com/post/typical-c-project-0&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick that in a folder with code, or code found in some directories. Then from a command-line, invoke the tool &lt;strong&gt;premake4&lt;/strong&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;premake4 --file=myfile.lua vs2008&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blam! Your prize, a Visual Studio 2008 project file and solution. Want 2010? Just change the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want it building elsewhere? Walk over to your Linux box, or your Cygwin/MinGW shell, and do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;premake4 --file=myfile.lua gmake&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have a makefile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, anyone that‚Äôs done project management knows that the above is just your most basic of projects. Standard C/C++ libraries, and whatnot. Per platform you still need to link versus external libraries (OpenGL, SDL, etc). No problem, just add new sections to your targets. includedirs, libs, libdirs, and so on. Want to apply a setting to both? just place it a level up in the hierarchy. Nearly everything you would normally do on a platform, there‚Äôs a means of adding content to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there‚Äôs little point having me regurgitate how to start using it, as the docs have a wonderful tutorial that steps through it. And once you get to the files stage of the tutorial, you can generate a usable project file with just that. Here‚Äôs the link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://industriousone.com/solutions-and-projects&#34;&gt;http://industriousone.com/solutions-and-projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one last tip though, is that the scripting interface is doing some housekeeping behind the scenes. The functions Solution, Project, and Configuration specifically. Calling them changes the scope of the calls that follow. This is important to note if you try to use normal Lua scripting activities, a ‚Äúprintf‚Äù will write to the console as the project is generated, but not while it runs. There‚Äôs a command for setting the actions at each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you can invoke &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171452%28v=vs.90%29.aspx&#34;&gt;MSBUILD&lt;/a&gt; from the command-line if you want to live in shell land (like me). Start a Visual Studio 2008 shell (under Start Menu/Visual Studio 2008/Visual Studio Tools/..), then browse to and invoke it as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;msbuild MySolution.sln /property:Configuration=Debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And presto. Your actual errors will be logged to the console window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hey, ahem, back on topic. If you‚Äôre not me, you can use something like this to do your project management work. I however have and REALLY LIKE a fancy GNU make based build system I wrote. Unfortunately, this only helps me when I‚Äôm developing for Windows, Linux, and certain devices. It does no good when I am actually required to use Visual Studio (certain libraries, DRM, SDK‚Äôs), or Xcode on Mac. But that‚Äôs where Premake comes in, to take care of that stuff for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some wild plans ahead, but I wanted my original working script available somewhere. Hit the jump for the full listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, it‚Äôs Lua, so double dashes are line comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Smiles has wrapped, so yes sir, I am working on my new game. Let the AWESOME begin!
Today I plowed through the massive task of finishing the redesign of my new build system, and moved the WIP game code over to it‚Äôs lovely new home. Lots of work, not much to show (at least, not in the mood to show yet).
But hey, I have this other thing.

The first is a response to a topic of inspiration posed by Andy Moore. I try to get out for walks as often as I can, and I bring with me a camera phone‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs what I see:
Next was something from this past weekend. I picked up an iCade, which is an arcade controller for an iPad, and I got it working with something NOT an iPad.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a new laptop (Lenovo X220) and made some upgrades (160 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM) making it a great little development machine. I like it so much, that I want to use it even for my Linux needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to do a post or series of posts whenever I do a notable Linux install, often because there are so many nuances you need to deal with that are easy to forget.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been making games for a really long time now, but one thing I‚Äôve found myself rather resilient to was letting myself use Middleware. By Middleware, I mean 3rd party libraries. It‚Äôs funny since I always highly recommend that people use it (to save RIDICULOUS amounts of time), but I myself am just a really slow adopter of it.
SDL is one of few long-time 3rd party libraries I use. It lets me write my game code against the PC, Mac, Linux, and a few mobiles including Palm/HP‚Äôs webOS and Nokia‚Äôs Maemo.</description>

      <description>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It‚Äôs been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me ‚Äî I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I‚Äôm there.</description>

      <title>Smiles in 64 bits</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/11/13/smiles-in-64-bits/</guid>
      <description>So I spent the evening getting Smiles working in 64bit Linux (Ubuntu 10.10) as well as the Mac. Here are the results:
And the Mac again:
And a closeup of the processes section:
Getting it working on the Mac wasn‚Äôt really necessary, but I really like Xcode‚Äôs debugging tools. They made tracing the issue very straightforward. I had two VNC windows going almost constantly, as I‚Äôd make changes on the Workstation PC, commit to SVN, and sync on both the Mac and the Zotac.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the meat of this post, last night I finished my ‚Äúearly‚Äù Mac App Store TODO list. I *COULD* submit it now, but there‚Äôs a bug with submissions. My iPad version is called Smiles HD, and so will be the Mac App Store version. Right now the names conflict, so I have to wait until this is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now it‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù. I sent the binary to some friends to double-check compatibility. So while I wait, it‚Äôs time to get on other ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, my Mac binary is only a 32bit Intel binary. My source &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; compile in 64bit mode, but runs in to issues. Smiles isn‚Äôt a game that needs 64bit addressing, but unlike Windows and OSX, 64bit Linux doesn‚Äôt support 32bit applications (not stock at least). So one of my next portability challenges is making my Smiles codebase support 64bit Intel and AMD chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from my Workstation PC and Macs, I have a lot of Netbooks. The Netbooks are what I usually use for Linux development. Unfortunately, all the Netbooks I currently have don‚Äôt support 64bit instructions (the current generation Intel Atom CPU‚Äôs do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ordered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zotacusa.com/zotac-mag-hd-nd01.html&#34;&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Zotac MAG&lt;/strong&gt; Nettop PC. For about $250 CAD (with a rebate), it‚Äôs a dual core Atom 330 running at 1.6 GHz, 2 GB of RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, with an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Ion&#34;&gt;NVidia ION&lt;/a&gt; chipset (GeForce 9400M). I‚Äôm technically lacking an AMD and ATI test machine, but I do have one of each elsewhere I can turn to if I run in to problems (both running Windows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version I ordered isn‚Äôt the most up to date (original NVidia ION, last year‚Äôs Dual Core Atom), which is on purpose. This is both a development and a test machine, and if I can buy one for $250, so will other people looking for a low cost PC‚Ä¶ not that an NVidia 9400M is anything to shake a stick at either. This gives me a good cross section of graphics hardware I can test in Linux (Intel GMA on the Netbooks, NVidia on the Nettop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I purchased my first Netbook a couple years back (an Acer Aspire One), I started a secondary blog where I recorded all my setup notes, thoughts, and learnings (new word!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here‚Äôs an extra little blog I created to share the super technical and super nuance details of a little project of mine. Turning a stock 8GB SSD Acer Aspire One running Linpus Linux in to an ideal lightweight coding machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything, it was a blog about me learning to use Linux for development. I know a lot more about working inside Linux now, but posts of mine like this I found extremely helpful when I started doing things like Moblin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/2008/10/intalling-console-applications.html&#34;&gt;http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/2008/10/intalling-console-applications.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the remainder of this blog post will be me walking through the setup steps taken to set up this new machine for development, and get my 32bit makefile running and building code. In retrospect, the recorded setup details should be identical no matter the CPU architecture (32bit or 64bit, though this was me doing it 64bit style).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/11/10/as-expected-twas-the-cache/</guid>
      <description>Not much to say or show, just that the performance problem was due to the textures being larger than the texture cache.
As it is now, on my Mac mini the game runs at under 8% CPU usage in the menus and Zen, and under 10% in Drop. The largest texture is 1024√ó1024, DXT5 compressed (4:1, or 1 MB). Before it was 1024√ó1024 uncompressed 32bit RGBA (1:1, or 4 MB). That either means the GMA 950 in these older Mac‚Äôs has 1 MB of cache, or perhaps 2 MB (I didn‚Äôt check with 16bit RGBA textures, but it‚Äôs unlikely).</description>

Yesterday was spent trying to get a 64bit version of Ubuntu running on my Media Center PC (i.e. my old dual core AMD workstation PC, now hooked up to the projector). My initial attempt of installing it to a USB key didn‚Äôt work, but I did eventually get it working using WUBI.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the items on my &lt;em&gt;seemingly infinite&lt;/em&gt; TODO list is to write an article about how to port an iPhone game to AppUp. Another item is to rework my blog layout and list all the actually useful content written here. I‚Äôve yet to do either, but I think I have here a good compromise for the 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do a-lot of emailing, and this past week I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lazy8studios.com/&#34;&gt;had a chat with a fellow developer&lt;/a&gt; who wanted some advice on porting his game. I sometimes forget about the hours of work that went in to figuring out the the right combination of Unix tools, Windows tools, cross platform libraries, and how to smash them together until they make something that actually works. So I sent him a very &lt;em&gt;to the point&lt;/em&gt; list of things that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime after that, I realized I should just post that e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I actually finished on Sunday, but the final mobile port of Smiles is now sent. The port is for Samsung‚Äôs Bada mobile platform. I was pleasantly surprised how straight forward it was to get things up and running there. The system API is very much like a C++ version of Apple‚Äôs ObjC iPhoneOS API. The whole endeavor took no more than 4 days worth of work.
So done!
I will continue to support the existing plethora of ports as needed, but now it‚Äôs time to switch gears, and get going on the new project!</description>

      <description>So finally, Smiles 1.1 for Netbooks (The Intel AppUp Center) has been submitted. Also, though Moblin Netbook Smiles was submitted last week, it came back with a very minor issue. That is now fixed, and sent as well. So Netbook Smiles == all done.
I have 1 last mobile port I‚Äôm doing, Samsung Bada. Again, Google wont let Canadians make Google Checkout Merchant accounts, so Android and NACL Smiles ports will be pending that, and a good motivator for each.</description>

      <description>The latest in the seemingly endless stream of ports (the first of the two implied quicker ports I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ though the 2nd one is sounding not so quick after all).
The N900 is a Linux (Maemo) based device, so I was literally able to pick up where I finished the Moblin (Linux) ports.
Admittedly, it was a bit of a scary port, since I was only initially able to get the game to do about 10 fps.</description>

Thanks for the tip Adam.

I FINALLY submitted my Moblin (Linux) AppUp port of Smiles late last night.</description>

      <description>I have a goal of switching my focus entirely to a new project starting in July, which is about 6 weeks away. My 30th birthday is the 6th, so my folks have been joking that‚Äôll be my gift to myself. Happy Birthday Mike, you can do something else now‚Ä¶ heh.
So to make that happen, I need to power through my list of pending platforms I want to cover, before back-burner‚Äôing the rest.</description>

      <description>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I‚Äôve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!
Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‚Äòeh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).
The past week I‚Äôve been busy with a variety of things.</description>

      <description>One of the sessions I saw at GDC this year was Palm‚Äôs talk about their new PDK (i.e. their native SDK). The promise was a Linux based mobile device featuring SDL and OpenGL ES. Since my Windows and Linux code base also uses SDL and OpenGL, that certainly caught my attention. In theory, all I need to do is just recompile my Linux version with their tools and I‚Äôm done, right?</description>

      <description>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I‚Äôll talk a little more about the ‚Äúday 1 FREE‚Äù experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn‚Äôt going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device.</description>

      <title>(Annoying) Differences between Visual Studio and GCC</title>
      <link>https://toonormal.com/2009/11/15/annoying-differences-between-visual-studio-and-gcc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, awesome C an C++ language features you‚Äôll learn to love in GCC, that‚Äôll break your heart if you ever have to use Visual Studio. üòâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a list I collected whilst getting my Smiles PC code to compile with Visual Studio 2008. Most have no equivalent in Visual Studio, but one simply has a slightly different syntax (compatible too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, long and technical. Hit the link if you‚Äôre up for the challenge. You‚Äôve been warned. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visual Studio projects for GCC/MinGW/Xcode coders</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things on my blogging TODO list is to show how I work. Many coders find it odd to hear that I work on Windows without Visual Studio, or that I work on the Mac by rarely touching the Mac. Just me, a text editor (a good one), and a bunch of useful scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my current project though (Smiles PC), I‚Äôve run in to a slight brick wall that requires me and my development &lt;em&gt;arch nemesis&lt;/em&gt; to join forces. It‚Äôs almost funny, but it‚Äôs been about 10 years since I‚Äôve had to touch a Microsoft compiler. Normally I‚Äôd be reluctant, but we‚Äôre talking a distribution issue here‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs how I get paid. üòâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today‚Äôs when I swallow my command line pride and get Smiles building with Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is long, nuanced, technical, and mostly for my own benefit. So if you‚Äôre up for an over analysis of Windows Developers &lt;em&gt;favorite&lt;/em&gt; development tool, hit the link.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is not what I‚Äôve been up to all year, but it is what I‚Äôm up to right now.
So, let‚Äôs introduce the project.
Officially, the project is named Smiles. Specifically though, the project‚Äôs working title is Smiles PC. Just as you‚Äôd expect, it‚Äôs Smiles the iPhone game for PC, Mac and Linux. Actually it‚Äôs more than that, but lets stick with this for now.
At it‚Äôs core, Smiles PC is about removing the dependencies of the iPhone from the game.</description>

      <description>As planned, Smiles Zen 1.3 and Smiles Drop 1.3 were sent late Friday night (technically 5 AM the next day). I made the mentioned addition of arrows after discovering some people didn‚Äôt realize you could click on the icon. Here‚Äôs a snap of that from the iPhone build on the PC.
I had some friends look at this screen, and got a good reaction from the ‚Äúlove hearts‚Äù, so I made a similar change to free version.</description>

      <description>Here‚Äôs something I hope to start doing more often. Technically, I‚Äôve been hoping to actually start all year. Short development video logs.
Today‚Äôs video is a demonstration of the cross promotion features in Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop. Inspiration hit last night, and I added something amusing to it I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd share.
Both builds should go out tonight. I‚Äôll be adding a pair of arrows beside the icon, just so it‚Äôs even clearer that you can click on it right here.</description>

      <description>Smiles 1.3 is already in the Apple queue, but not Zen and Drop yet. Something ‚Äúnew‚Äù in 1.3 is that I removed the ‚Äúhow to play music‚Äù instructions from the game. This used to be in the upper right corner of the screen. The description used to say you could ‚Äúdouble tap‚Äù the home button to bring up music playback, but it seems that was wrong on the iPhones and 3rd gen iPods.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Smiles</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2009/02/28/aspects-of-smiles/</guid>
      <description>The first step with Smiles was to up the art resolution. That way, I could cleanly resize to any resolution below 4x the iPhone (1920√ó1280).
Unfortunately, double and quadruple iPhone res are not practical resolutions. Double iPhone will work windowed on most desktop LCD and 720p screens (960√ó640), and quadruple in a window fits on a 30‚Ä≥ Dell or Apple Cinema display, but we could do better.
Also, not all screens are the same shape, but the solution isn‚Äôt too difficult.</description>

      <description>Alright, I don‚Äôt see a reason not to talk about this publicly. So if I‚Äôm a good boy, I‚Äôll be walking through my process of up-scaling, converting, and porting Smiles as it happens. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to have the game available for all 3 desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Quickly, Smiles is an IGF Mobile nominated collection of puzzle games for iPhone. You can learn more about the game at smiles-game.</description>

(400k JPEG Version, 1 MB Lossless PNG Version)
Rebuilt the texture atlas‚Äô for the weather and vegetables tilesets, and resized the majority of the in game assets. 3x‚Äôd the iPhone res instead of 4x‚Äôd, as that would be far too huge.
Art is large enough for 1080p, but the game needs numerous changes to properly support the new aspect ratio(s).</description>

To start, I‚Äôm going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year.</description>

      <description>At first glance you wouldn‚Äôt think a matching game like Smiles would feature physics, but it does. In several places actually.
The most obvious example is the particle effects.
Particles were used when ice and rocks break, and also for the tile clearing effect. The tile would be erased instantly from the board, and a particle would be created in it‚Äôs place. The particle would zoom in, slow down, then zoom out with a twist.</description>

      <description>Rather spontaneously, I decided to put Smiles Drop on sale for New Years.
So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab Smiles Drop for the extremely reasonable price of $1.99 (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy Smiles Zen after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on Smiles. Well‚Ä¶ you might save a penny buying separately, but still.</description>

Here‚Äôs your chance to hear and mock Mike. I‚Äôve been getting a number of positive and amusing comments from the video. Such fun things as that I sound like an Infomercial host, and music sounds like ‚Äúcorporate training music‚Äù. Finishing this video has been an incredible hassle.

Search for ‚ÄúSmiles‚Äù and scroll down a bit, or browse the puzzle or strategy categories in iTunes.
Contrary to the description, it‚Äôs an Action Puzzler. Lumines/Metoes ‚Äòesc, or Bejeweled on crack.
Thanks to some fancy design kung fu, it‚Äôs also what the description says. But that‚Äôs a topic all in itself.

The last game I did TRC for was Atomic Betty, the Gameboy Advance game I worked on before leaving Big Blue Bubble. That would have been some time during July of 2005. That finished up, and I was a free man for August 1st.
By TRC I mean Technical Requirements Checklist. Every platform holder has them, though they sometimes have a different name for them. A TRC is a combination of guidelines.</description>

Rule of thumb. When Mike says game will be out in a week or two, assume month. Then assume longer.
Ahem.
There‚Äôs always the chance that this mysterious iPhone game may destroy my ‚Äòcred‚Äô as a physics guy. Though, I‚Äôve been doing some fun stuff in it to rectify that.
I‚Äôve found several uses for effects based on verlet and spring physics, even though the game lives in a world of tiles.</description>

      <description>Ballistic Force wasn‚Äôt a long project, but development was dense.
Early on, I attempted a poorly conceived idea of creating densely constructed particle landscape. I wanted a system sort of like molecular/planetary attraction to keep scenery together, and allow clumping like a cartoon snowball rolling down a hill. It might have worked on something highly parallel like a GPU or the PS3‚Äôs SPE‚Äôs, but my design really wasn‚Äôt well thought out.</description>

      <description>This next engines name and story is a little complicated.
Game development became a constant burn out for me. Since finishing Secret Agent Barbie (Gameboy Advance) and Polly Pocket (Gameboy Advance), it became clear to me the only thing keeping me going was my fascination with new platforms. Certainly not the subject matter.
After we finished Polly Pocket, I asked for a month off to deal with my burn out. However, we quickly picked up a new game, Barbie: Gotta Have Games (Playstation).</description>

      <description>Over the years, I‚Äôve given names to game engines I‚Äôve worked on. Most of my professional experience has been working on platformers and mini-game collections. Mini-games rarely share much in common, so by engines I‚Äôm referring to platformers, or engines for games very much like platformers.
I‚Äôd like to start talking about what I‚Äôve been thinking about whilst designing my next engine. I need to set some context though, so I‚Äôll be walking through some of more significant engines I‚Äôve worked on.</description>

      <description>Last post talked about the random thoughts I‚Äôve had about how to pull off the rope dynamics in Umihara Kawase, this classic SNES game that drives us all mad. I made some bold suggestions, and decided to try them. After a couple hours of work, while not as complete as I want, it‚Äôs far enough along to be able to demonstrate to me if I have a right idea or not.</description>

      <description>Raigan and I have had an extremely brief dialog on in game ropes. It makes sense, for a while we were both doing rope driven games.
Well, due to my failings as a communicator, I sort of just never got back to him. Yet, I absolutely love the topic, and certainly spent much time puzzled by it. Apparently I‚Äôve also made the conscious effort to push my way in to obscurity.</description>

Anyone that‚Äôs followed my work probably won‚Äôt be miffed by that mean looking first word. But if you stuck around, you stuck around for my work, not my clever name. You probably have your own pronunciation of it too. I‚Äôve certainly heard some interesting ones from telemarketers that whois‚Äôd my domains for a phone number.

      <description>Ranting‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. I suppose I‚Äôve been ‚Äúwriting‚Äù music with trackers for about 13 years (Scream, Impulse, Modplug, Buzz, Renoise). Alas, my results have been less than satisfactory. I want to take this moment to apologize to everyone I ever recommended trackers to.
Sorry.
Sometime last month I set out to find a better music app. I‚Äôd already entered the world of VST‚Äôs thanks to Renoise, having put down a big $600 for Colossus.</description>

      <description>Here‚Äôs a fun point. Almost everyone works at a desk, but nobody talks about desks. Chairs come up sometimes, especially in discussions about the Aeron chair versus a well made leather, or general sitting ergonomics.
This is an incredibly broad topic that could easily span dozens of blog posts in it‚Äôs complexity. Game developers and other media professionals have many needs for their working surface. And depending on how many hats you wear as a developer, you‚Äôve got to fit several monitors, speakers (stereo or surround), input devices (keyboards, mice, tablets, midi interfaces), scanners, printers, and other office friendly objects (fans, phones, paper and supplies) on it.</description>

      <description>This is part of a forum post I made. Classic Mike, going completely off topic and force feeding all the random advice I had saved up.
‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
Be sure your input update is written/recorded immediately before the game processes it. In other words, at the end your control interpretation code/handler. That way it can ‚Äúin theory‚Äù reproduce a crash, instead of coming up a frame or two short.</description>

      <description>This is from a forum post I made in response to a question on testing methods. A classic Mike random advice assault. This branched off to a series of thoughts on built in game recorders.
‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
Free testing methods:
Peer testing has worked well for me, as developers tend to have bizarre PC configurations (multiple monitors, multiple gamepads, etc). There‚Äôs also a level of critique a developer can give that goes above and beyond, but you need to be clear and capable of asking for the harshest of critiques.</description>

      <description>From a forum post, a set of bullet point advice on creating a custom archive format.
‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
‚Äì For terms: Archives are a directory/dictionary/list of filenames with offsets to chunks, and many data chunks (files). Compression comes later.
‚Äì Directories and subdirectories are just longer filenames. Unlimited file name length means unlimited directories.
‚Äì Padding the start of data chunks to 4 byte boundaries has performance advantages on many platforms when in RAM.</description>

      <description>I was busy last month cutting together a trailer for‚Ä¶ business purposes. I‚Äôll talk more about this later. It turned out surprisingly more difficult that I had have hoped, but I found a rather unique way of pulling it together.
Obviously, the secret weapon is Fraps. Trying to nab constant 60fps footage was doable, but proved tricky, due to my hard drives not being the most defragged. I don‚Äôt know how many takes later, I ended up with nearly an hour of game footage, that was cut down to a 4 minute presentation.</description>

      <description>You see, what‚Äôs fun about big computers is‚Ä¶ oh wait‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no fun here.
Back sometime in ‚Äò98, whilst I was working in a computer store, my fascination with big computer crap began. And I purchased this massive ‚ÄúServer‚Äù case, which was PC‚Äôs case for a couple years. Eventually, this behemoth of a case was ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù to an actual server, since routine maintenance/upgrades were painful given it‚Äôs shear mass.
Then in ‚Äò04, I had the brilliant idea to purchase the biggest, fattest Laptop mankind has ever seen.</description>

The post is of similar quality and length to what I‚Äôd normally constitute a ‚Äúblog post‚Äù, so I‚Äôm dropping it here so I don‚Äôt forget. It‚Äôs certainly not a surefire answer to anything, just a stroll through me solving a problem.
The set up: SVN, a great tool for backups, versioning, and synchronization, can and should be used in all aspects of development.</description>

      <description>Alright, this was inspired from a game idea I had a few years ago. In the midst of working on my new physics engine, I‚Äôve decided to revisit the idea and noticed an oddity in my design. Balloons.
Balloons are interesting. Unlike most objects in a game situation, they have this odd property of opposing gravity and going up. With that alone, we can do a convincing simulation in a game by consistently giving it an upward force larger than gravity.</description>
