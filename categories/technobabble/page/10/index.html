    <h2>Smiles running on the Palm Pre, plus other things</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the sessions I saw at GDC this year was Palm‚Äôs talk about their new PDK (i.e. their native SDK). The promise was a Linux based mobile device featuring SDL and OpenGL ES. Since my Windows and Linux code base also uses SDL and OpenGL, that certainly caught my attention. In theory, all I need to do is just recompile my Linux version with their tools and I‚Äôm done, right?...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Wow! So that was iPad launch day.
I‚Äôll talk a little more about the ‚Äúday 1 FREE‚Äù experiment after some results. Just before disappearing, the game was sitting at #60 in the Top FREE Apps (#13 Top FREE Games). Earlier today, I caught it at #55. Anyways, I said I wasn‚Äôt going to talk about this!
Like many other developers, I shipped the game to Apple for launch day without actually testing it on a real device....</p>

    <h2>(Annoying) Differences between Visual Studio and GCC</h2>

    <p>Or in other words, awesome C an C&#43;&#43; language features you‚Äôll learn to love in GCC, that‚Äôll break your heart if you ever have to use Visual Studio. üòâ
This is a list I collected whilst getting my Smiles PC code to compile with Visual Studio 2008. Most have no equivalent in Visual Studio, but one simply has a slightly different syntax (compatible too).
As before, long and technical. Hit the link if you‚Äôre up for the challenge. You‚Äôve been warned. üòÄ

    <h2>Visual Studio projects for GCC/MinGW/Xcode coders</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the things on my blogging TODO list is to show how I work. Many coders find it odd to hear that I work on Windows without Visual Studio, or that I work on the Mac by rarely touching the Mac. Just me, a text editor (a good one), and a bunch of useful scripting.
In my current project though (Smiles PC), I‚Äôve run in to a slight brick wall that requires me and my development arch nemesis to join forces. It‚Äôs almost funny, but it‚Äôs been about 10 years since I‚Äôve had to touch a Microsoft compiler. Normally I‚Äôd be reluctant, but we‚Äôre talking a distribution issue here‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs how I get paid. üòâ
So, today‚Äôs when I swallow my command line pride and get Smiles building with Visual Studio.
This post is long, nuanced, technical, and mostly for my own benefit. So if you‚Äôre up for an over analysis of Windows Developers favorite development tool, hit the link.

    <h2>Introducing Smiles PC</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This is not what I‚Äôve been up to all year, but it is what I‚Äôm up to right now.
So, let‚Äôs introduce the project.
Officially, the project is named Smiles. Specifically though, the project‚Äôs working title is Smiles PC. Just as you‚Äôd expect, it‚Äôs Smiles the iPhone game for PC, Mac and Linux. Actually it‚Äôs more than that, but lets stick with this for now.
At it‚Äôs core, Smiles PC is about removing the dependencies of the iPhone from the game....</p>

    <h2>Final cross promotion and freebie changes</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>As planned, Smiles Zen 1.3 and Smiles Drop 1.3 were sent late Friday night (technically 5 AM the next day). I made the mentioned addition of arrows after discovering some people didn‚Äôt realize you could click on the icon. Here‚Äôs a snap of that from the iPhone build on the PC.
I had some friends look at this screen, and got a good reaction from the ‚Äúlove hearts‚Äù, so I made a similar change to free version....</p>

    <h2>Video: Cross promotion in Smiles</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Here‚Äôs something I hope to start doing more often. Technically, I‚Äôve been hoping to actually start all year. Short development video logs.
Today‚Äôs video is a demonstration of the cross promotion features in Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop. Inspiration hit last night, and I added something amusing to it I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd share.
Both builds should go out tonight. I‚Äôll be adding a pair of arrows beside the icon, just so it‚Äôs even clearer that you can click on it right here....</p>

    <h2>Cross promotion in Zen and Drop</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Smiles 1.3 is already in the Apple queue, but not Zen and Drop yet. Something ‚Äúnew‚Äù in 1.3 is that I removed the ‚Äúhow to play music‚Äù instructions from the game. This used to be in the upper right corner of the screen. The description used to say you could ‚Äúdouble tap‚Äù the home button to bring up music playback, but it seems that was wrong on the iPhones and 3rd gen iPods....</p>

    <h2>Aspects of Smiles</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The first step with Smiles was to up the art resolution. That way, I could cleanly resize to any resolution below 4x the iPhone (1920√ó1280).
Unfortunately, double and quadruple iPhone res are not practical resolutions. Double iPhone will work windowed on most desktop LCD and 720p screens (960√ó640), and quadruple in a window fits on a 30‚Ä≥ Dell or Apple Cinema display, but we could do better.
Also, not all screens are the same shape, but the solution isn‚Äôt too difficult....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Alright, I don‚Äôt see a reason not to talk about this publicly. So if I‚Äôm a good boy, I‚Äôll be walking through my process of up-scaling, converting, and porting Smiles as it happens. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to have the game available for all 3 desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Quickly, Smiles is an IGF Mobile nominated collection of puzzle games for iPhone. You can learn more about the game at smiles-game....</p>
