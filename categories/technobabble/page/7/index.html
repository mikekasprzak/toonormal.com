    <h2>A Better MinGW &#43; MSys Shell</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-meta">

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Pekka posed a good question recently that got me thinking: The default Bash shell that comes with MinGW (MSys) kinda sucks. You can’t resize the Window, selections are this odd visible only thing, in essence: it works like an ordinary windows cmd shell.
The solution is surprisingly straight forward: Use MinTTY.
Open up a MinGW shell, and do the following:
 mingw-get install mintty
 A few moments later, you’ll have MinTTY installed....</p>

The past month has been extremely good for progress. I did not meet my goal for the month, but I’d be silly to complain. Yadda yadda ya.
Against my better judgement, I’m going to stop beating around the bush and show you:
A mish-mash or random objects sitting in some sculpted terrain. Subtle glow. Vignette blur.
 That’s cool Mike, but what is it?

    <p>Last week, a drive in my server died. These drives weren’t really that old, but were Seagate’s from the drive failing epidemic a few years back. I bought 6 drives around this time, 4 for the server in a RAID 10 array, 2 for my workstation. I lost 1 to the failure problem, and the rest I managed to get updated firmwares installed in time.
Since then, I have been extremely leery of Seagate drives....</p>

    <p>This past couple weeks I’ve been busily working on architecting many little things (super important things) for my new game. One of the big things I really didn’t set out to do initially, but once I realized my efforts were converging there, I decided to make it a priority: Live Coding.
I am using a scripting language Squirrel to handle the gameplay side of the programming. This is new for me, having hardcoded or written my own sub-par scripting and data entry dialects to make my prior games....</p>

    <h2>Premake: My new best friend (RE: MSVC, Xcode)</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-meta">
    <time>July 31, 2011</time>
  </div>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Alright, I’ve spammed the twitterverse enough.
Here’s something I started playing with today, and finished just a few hours later, satisfied. Premake. In essence, it’s a build script and project file maker, just like CMake and Scons. It uses Lua scripting, to contrast custom and python for the others (CMake a Scons respectfully).
If you weren’t me, you could save yourself a slew of portability headaches with this simple script.
(From here)
Stick that in a folder with code, or code found in some directories. Then from a command-line, invoke the tool premake4 as follows:
premake4 --file=myfile.lua vs2008
Blam! Your prize, a Visual Studio 2008 project file and solution. Want 2010? Just change the argument.
Want it building elsewhere? Walk over to your Linux box, or your Cygwin/MinGW shell, and do this:
premake4 --file=myfile.lua gmake
You now have a makefile.
Of course, anyone that’s done project management knows that the above is just your most basic of projects. Standard C/C&#43;&#43; libraries, and whatnot. Per platform you still need to link versus external libraries (OpenGL, SDL, etc). No problem, just add new sections to your targets. includedirs, libs, libdirs, and so on. Want to apply a setting to both? just place it a level up in the hierarchy. Nearly everything you would normally do on a platform, there’s a means of adding content to that.
Honestly, there’s little point having me regurgitate how to start using it, as the docs have a wonderful tutorial that steps through it. And once you get to the files stage of the tutorial, you can generate a usable project file with just that. Here’s the link:
http://industriousone.com/solutions-and-projects
My one last tip though, is that the scripting interface is doing some housekeeping behind the scenes. The functions Solution, Project, and Configuration specifically. Calling them changes the scope of the calls that follow. This is important to note if you try to use normal Lua scripting activities, a “printf” will write to the console as the project is generated, but not while it runs. There’s a command for setting the actions at each stage.
Oh, and you can invoke MSBUILD from the command-line if you want to live in shell land (like me). Start a Visual Studio 2008 shell (under Start Menu/Visual Studio 2008/Visual Studio Tools/..), then browse to and invoke it as follows.
msbuild MySolution.sln /property:Configuration=Debug
And presto. Your actual errors will be logged to the console window.
* * *
So hey, ahem, back on topic. If you’re not me, you can use something like this to do your project management work. I however have and REALLY LIKE a fancy GNU make based build system I wrote. Unfortunately, this only helps me when I’m developing for Windows, Linux, and certain devices. It does no good when I am actually required to use Visual Studio (certain libraries, DRM, SDK’s), or Xcode on Mac. But that’s where Premake comes in, to take care of that stuff for me.
I have some wild plans ahead, but I wanted my original working script available somewhere. Hit the jump for the full listing.
Remember, it’s Lua, so double dashes are line comments.

Today I plowed through the massive task of finishing the redesign of my new build system, and moved the WIP game code over to it’s lovely new home. Lots of work, not much to show (at least, not in the mood to show yet).
But hey, I have this other thing.
Yesterday I received a Hydra motion controller from Razer in the mail....</p>
