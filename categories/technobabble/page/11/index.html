Rebuilt the texture atlas‚Äô for the weather and vegetables tilesets, and resized the majority of the in game assets. 3x‚Äôd the iPhone res instead of 4x‚Äôd, as that would be far too huge.
Art is large enough for 1080p, but the game needs numerous changes to properly support the new aspect ratio(s)....</p>

    <h2>The Development of Smiles, Part 0</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I know my track record for completing a blog series is pretty lousy, but this one should be easier. I kept a personal log with pictures during the development of Smiles, so most of the work is done for me. I just need need to go through it and regurgitate my notes.
To start, I‚Äôm going to give a bit of insight in to what happened when I stopped writing my Engines, Names and Evolution blog series last year....</p>

    <h2>Physics in Smiles</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>At first glance you wouldn‚Äôt think a matching game like Smiles would feature physics, but it does. In several places actually.
The most obvious example is the particle effects.
Particles were used when ice and rocks break, and also for the tile clearing effect. The tile would be erased instantly from the board, and a particle would be created in it‚Äôs place. The particle would zoom in, slow down, then zoom out with a twist....</p>

    <h2>Smiles Drop New Years Sale, More</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Rather spontaneously, I decided to put Smiles Drop on sale for New Years.
So for a limited time (i.e. some time early Jan 2nd morning) you can grab Smiles Drop for the extremely reasonable price of $1.99 (save $1). That puts it in check, so you can buy Smiles Zen after that, and have paid the same price as buying full on Smiles. Well‚Ä¶ you might save a penny buying separately, but still....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Final version of the Smiles video. It‚Äôs the short one again, but with me talking.
Here‚Äôs your chance to hear and mock Mike. I‚Äôve been getting a number of positive and amusing comments from the video. Such fun things as that I sound like an Infomercial host, and music sounds like ‚Äúcorporate training music‚Äù. Finishing this video has been an incredible hassle. Hard drives dying, frequent reboots, loss of WAV file playback in Windows, and YouTube difficulties....</p>

    <p>One of two promotional videos I‚Äôm making. This one is the ‚Äúhands on‚Äù one, requiring a silly looking ‚Äúcamera on tripod hugging thing‚Äù to collect all the footage.

In this video, I‚Äôm unfortunately assuming the player will pick up on all the nice things why this isn‚Äôt a Bejeweled clone. But to be sure, I‚Äôm going to spell it out next video, and briefly mention some of things not covered here....</p>

    <p>Just got back from the grocery store, and got the word. ‚ÄúReady for Sale‚Äú.
http://appshopper.com/games/smiles
Search for ‚ÄúSmiles‚Äù and scroll down a bit, or browse the puzzle or strategy categories in iTunes.
Contrary to the description, it‚Äôs an Action Puzzler. Lumines/Metoes ‚Äòesc, or Bejeweled on crack.
Thanks to some fancy design kung fu, it‚Äôs also what the description says. But that‚Äôs a topic all in itself.
