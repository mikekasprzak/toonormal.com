    <h2>Conversation: Some unusual topics</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Here’s a couple videos from the series, some of the more odd things I’ve posted.
The first is a response to a topic of inspiration posed by Andy Moore. I try to get out for walks as often as I can, and I bring with me a camera phone… here’s what I see:
Next was something from this past weekend. I picked up an iCade, which is an arcade controller for an iPad, and I got it working with something NOT an iPad....</p>

    <h2>Linux Notes from setting up Laptop 2011</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I recently purchased a new laptop (Lenovo X220) and made some upgrades (160 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM) making it a great little development machine. I like it so much, that I want to use it even for my Linux needs.
I like to do a post or series of posts whenever I do a notable Linux install, often because there are so many nuances you need to deal with that are easy to forget.

    <h2>Mike and Middleware</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve been making games for a really long time now, but one thing I’ve found myself rather resilient to was letting myself use Middleware. By Middleware, I mean 3rd party libraries. It’s funny since I always highly recommend that people use it (to save RIDICULOUS amounts of time), but I myself am just a really slow adopter of it.
SDL is one of few long-time 3rd party libraries I use. It lets me write my game code against the PC, Mac, Linux, and a few mobiles including Palm/HP’s webOS and Nokia’s Maemo....</p>

    <p>2011 is here! The IGF finalists have been announced, CES is upon us, and GDC is less than 2 months away. I always have a hard time following up epic posts like the last one. So with this, my third attempt (ahem), I’m going to try to be more to the point: My plans for the year.
First, the Mac App Store launches on Thursday… I wonder if Mike did something for that?...</p>

    <h2>Toggling Windows</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Added a toggle button for Windowed and Fullscreen today, and made it actually work. I also did some tweaking of the icons around the edge of the screen (pushed them higher, made the outlines more consistent).
The About/Credits screen icon is now a speech bubble (was a “?”, so not to confuse it with the help menu). Just a few more tweaks to go before I dive in to Android....</p>

    <h2>Achievement Unlock Sound Effect</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I am a regular twitter user. I run a client (twhirl) in the corner of my right monitor, so for me it works like a weird combination of an IM client and RSS reader.
A couple days ago, I caught glance of this request from Noel Llopis (developer of Flower Garden, Dr. Seuss’ Lorax Garden, and the upcoming Casey’s Contraptions).
That’s a good question. As far as I know there’s no real “standard” achievement sound (unless you want to rip-off Microsoft)....</p>

    <h2>Eighty Five Percent</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Alright, time to get back in to the routine.
It’s been two weeks since the last post. Last week became an impromptu holiday for me — I am a Canadian living in Canada, but I deal mostly with US companies, so American Thanksgiving seemed safe.
The week prior was busy though. I sent off the initial version of Smiles HD for the Mac App Store. It still sits in the approval queue, but I’m there....</p>

    <h2>Smiles in 64 bits</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>So I spent the evening getting Smiles working in 64bit Linux (Ubuntu 10.10) as well as the Mac. Here are the results:
And the Mac again:
And a closeup of the processes section:
Getting it working on the Mac wasn’t really necessary, but I really like Xcode’s debugging tools. They made tracing the issue very straightforward. I had two VNC windows going almost constantly, as I’d make changes on the Workstation PC, commit to SVN, and sync on both the Mac and the Zotac....</p>

    <h2>Ubuntu on the Zotac</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Before I get to the meat of this post, last night I finished my “early” Mac App Store TODO list. I *COULD* submit it now, but there’s a bug with submissions. My iPad version is called Smiles HD, and so will be the Mac App Store version. Right now the names conflict, so I have to wait until this is fixed.
For now it’s “done”. I sent the binary to some friends to double-check compatibility. So while I wait, it’s time to get on other ports.
Notably, my Mac binary is only a 32bit Intel binary. My source does compile in 64bit mode, but runs in to issues. Smiles isn’t a game that needs 64bit addressing, but unlike Windows and OSX, 64bit Linux doesn’t support 32bit applications (not stock at least). So one of my next portability challenges is making my Smiles codebase support 64bit Intel and AMD chips.
* * *
Aside from my Workstation PC and Macs, I have a lot of Netbooks. The Netbooks are what I usually use for Linux development. Unfortunately, all the Netbooks I currently have don’t support 64bit instructions (the current generation Intel Atom CPU’s do).
So I ordered one of these, a Zotac MAG Nettop PC. For about $250 CAD (with a rebate), it’s a dual core Atom 330 running at 1.6 GHz, 2 GB of RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, with an NVidia ION chipset (GeForce 9400M). I’m technically lacking an AMD and ATI test machine, but I do have one of each elsewhere I can turn to if I run in to problems (both running Windows).
The version I ordered isn’t the most up to date (original NVidia ION, last year’s Dual Core Atom), which is on purpose. This is both a development and a test machine, and if I can buy one for $250, so will other people looking for a low cost PC… not that an NVidia 9400M is anything to shake a stick at either. This gives me a good cross section of graphics hardware I can test in Linux (Intel GMA on the Netbooks, NVidia on the Nettop).
When I purchased my first Netbook a couple years back (an Acer Aspire One), I started a secondary blog where I recorded all my setup notes, thoughts, and learnings (new word!!).
http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/
 So here’s an extra little blog I created to share the super technical and super nuance details of a little project of mine. Turning a stock 8GB SSD Acer Aspire One running Linpus Linux in to an ideal lightweight coding machine.
 More than anything, it was a blog about me learning to use Linux for development. I know a lot more about working inside Linux now, but posts of mine like this I found extremely helpful when I started doing things like Moblin:
http://aspireonedev.blogspot.com/2008/10/intalling-console-applications.html
So the remainder of this blog post will be me walking through the setup steps taken to set up this new machine for development, and get my 32bit makefile running and building code. In retrospect, the recorded setup details should be identical no matter the CPU architecture (32bit or 64bit, though this was me doing it 64bit style).

    <h2>As expected, twas the Cache</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Not much to say or show, just that the performance problem was due to the textures being larger than the texture cache.
As it is now, on my Mac mini the game runs at under 8% CPU usage in the menus and Zen, and under 10% in Drop. The largest texture is 1024×1024, DXT5 compressed (4:1, or 1 MB). Before it was 1024×1024 uncompressed 32bit RGBA (1:1, or 4 MB). That either means the GMA 950 in these older Mac’s has 1 MB of cache, or perhaps 2 MB (I didn’t check with 16bit RGBA textures, but it’s unlikely)....</p>
