    <p>This week I’ve been downloading updates for all my tools. Linux distros, as well as Apple tools and OS updates. Yesterday was spent trying to get a 64bit version of Ubuntu running on my Media Center PC (i.e. my old dual core AMD workstation PC, now hooked up to the projector). My initial attempt of installing it to a USB key didn’t work, but I did eventually get it working using WUBI....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the items on my seemingly infinite TODO list is to write an article about how to port an iPhone game to AppUp. Another item is to rework my blog layout and list all the actually useful content written here. I’ve yet to do either, but I think I have here a good compromise for the 1st.
I do a-lot of emailing, and this past week I had a chat with a fellow developer who wanted some advice on porting his game. I sometimes forget about the hours of work that went in to figuring out the the right combination of Unix tools, Windows tools, cross platform libraries, and how to smash them together until they make something that actually works. So I sent him a very to the point list of things that I do.
Sometime after that, I realized I should just post that e-mail.

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Somewhere on my agenda is writing up some articles on how to port from iPhone to some of the other cool platforms out there (PC/AppUp, Palm, etc). I’m always rather busy though, when I finish one thing I’m often on to the next one.
I have numerous developer friends I regularly chat with on IRC, Forums and e-mail, since we tend to be doing the same things with our games (porting, marketing, etc)....</p>

    <h2>The final mobile port (for now)</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I actually finished on Sunday, but the final mobile port of Smiles is now sent. The port is for Samsung’s Bada mobile platform. I was pleasantly surprised how straight forward it was to get things up and running there. The system API is very much like a C&#43;&#43; version of Apple’s ObjC iPhoneOS API. The whole endeavor took no more than 4 days worth of work.
So done!
I will continue to support the existing plethora of ports as needed, but now it’s time to switch gears, and get going on the new project!...</p>

    <p>So finally, Smiles 1.1 for Netbooks (The Intel AppUp Center) has been submitted. Also, though Moblin Netbook Smiles was submitted last week, it came back with a very minor issue. That is now fixed, and sent as well. So Netbook Smiles == all done.
I have 1 last mobile port I’m doing, Samsung Bada. Again, Google wont let Canadians make Google Checkout Merchant accounts, so Android and NACL Smiles ports will be pending that, and a good motivator for each....</p>

    <p>The latest in the seemingly endless stream of ports (the first of the two implied quicker ports I’m doing… though the 2nd one is sounding not so quick after all).
The N900 is a Linux (Maemo) based device, so I was literally able to pick up where I finished the Moblin (Linux) ports.
Admittedly, it was a bit of a scary port, since I was only initially able to get the game to do about 10 fps....</p>

    <p>Heh, I certainly wasn’t expecting this.
RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I’m now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I’ve been using UltraVNC on my PC’s recently, though I do run their iPhone client. 😉
Thanks for the tip Adam.

I FINALLY submitted my Moblin (Linux) AppUp port of Smiles late last night....</p>

So to make that happen, I need to power through my list of pending platforms I want to cover, before back-burner’ing the rest....</p>

    <p>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I’ve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!
Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‘eh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).
The past week I’ve been busy with a variety of things....</p>
