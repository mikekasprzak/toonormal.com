      <description>Most people don‚Äôt know we have a blog syndication sub-site on Ludum Dare called the Ludum Dare Planet. It‚Äôs an extra WordPress blog and site that eats very few resources, but still needs to be regularly updated.
For the sake of security, I‚Äôll be taking the down the planet website. I‚Äôm going to wait a few days first, but if nobody responds, I‚Äôll just take it down. If you need time to grab your favorite RSS feeds, come to my blog (http://toonormal.</description>

      <description>Here‚Äôs something different.
Been working on the HTML5 side of my library code, and I kinda made this little demo for fun. Music is Garth Knight‚Äôs track Activate the Cage.
Ludum Dare 30 is this weekend. Hoo boy! Running that crazyfest is keeping me sooo busy. üôÇ</description>

      <description>Time to start the year right. After much folley and a good chunk of contract work last year, I started working on a new project. Some of the early-most efforts can be seen in the Quack tech demo video. No gameplay to see there, but you can see one of my prouder achievements in action: Live Coding/Live Content. Change a source file or an asset, and it updates in game immediately.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I run an online game-jam event called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ludum Dare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and this past weekend I got together with a friend (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/laufman&#34;&gt;Derek Laufman&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.halfbot.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halfbot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and we made a game. What did we make? A platformer about size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was created over a period 72 hours. Somehow, amazing to me, we managed to pull it together despite our responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me running the event (Ludum Dare)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family gathering at my brothers I attended on the Saturday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Car appointment on Monday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derek taking care of his baby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, running Ludum Dare is only busy for me before the event, and at submission time (two of them, 3-5 hours each). During the event I‚Äôm free to sit down and do whatever I want. This weekend was the &lt;strong&gt;Diablo 3 beta test&lt;/strong&gt;, and if I was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markfassett.com&#34;&gt;lesser man&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôd have played that. Fortunately for me, Derek came to me a couple weeks ago and suggested we make a game together, I said yes, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs totally silly, but I‚Äôm actually proud of the fact that I managed to attend the family gathering and the car appointment. Stupid me, I could have actually cancelled/rescheduled the appointment for Tuesday or Wednesday, but I decided to go ahead with it anyway. The car appointment was my &lt;a href=&#34;https://toonormal.com/2010/04/08/automobiles-interviews-all-smiles/&#34;&gt;yearly service for my smartcar&lt;/a&gt;, and I ended up staying in the neighborhood of the dealership for about 5 hours of that day. Working on my Ludum Dare game on my laptop, I had WIFI at the dealership, and also McDonalds, where I parked myself for a couple hours. To be honest, this was probably the first time I seriously ‚ÄúCoffee Shop Developed‚Äù, and where I actually got some serious work done. It was fun, because it was out of the ordinary. üôÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, that‚Äôs enough back story. Lets get nerdy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I wont talk too much about how Ludum Dare itself went, as I‚Äôve already done that over here.
But in addition to running the event, I participated for the first time in a long time. The theme was ‚ÄúAlone‚Äú, which I find funny given the title of my game. Could I not enter? üòâ
About a week before Ludum Dare, I started toying with the idea of creating a demake of my game.</description>

      <description>October is a very special month at Ludum Dare. Here‚Äôs a post I just did on Gamasutra blogs.
 Hey! I‚Äôm Mike, an Independent Game Developer up in Canada, and one of the main people behind the Ludum Dare Online Game Jam event. I‚Äôm here to invite you to participate in a very special event we‚Äôre running this month, The October Challenge.
The Challenge isn‚Äôt your typical game jam, but the rules are simple:</description>

      <description>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs now half way through the month, and progress on my ‚ÄúOctober Game‚Äù is minimal to say the least. I suppose that was to be expected, since I did have several things to finish this month. My week-days have been filled with various tasks, leaving only weekends to work on this new thing. Next week I‚Äôll be busy with my ‚Äú1 more thing‚Äù, leaving me the last week of October for a final crunch.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been doing my daily logs over at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/&#34;&gt;Ludum Dare site&lt;/a&gt;, to try and encourage more people to participate there. I‚Äôve really only worked on the game for 2 days, despite my plans to start early. Today I was busy with &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt;, so this week‚Äôs update will be light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ‚Äúweek‚Äù was about getting the foundation of editor up and running. Currently it works on a 2 button mouse (right click to erase), but the editing interface will support a touch screen (tile zero is the eraser). There‚Äôs currently no UI, but I can cycle tiles with the mouse wheel. It auto saves/loads the map to a specific file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started out looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PoVGame03.png&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then by the end of the night Saturday, it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/PoVGame07.png&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre interested at all in the process from A to B, hit the jump for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; going to do some work today (Sunday), but there‚Äôs so little time left, I‚Äôm calling it a night early.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The response to the October Challenge has been incredible! I think the one thing that‚Äôs most amazing about it: everybody gets it. Every appearance of it on the internet has encouraged a plethora of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in!‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ON like Donkey Kong!‚Äù responses. I‚Äôve had dozens of direct tweets and people hunt me down in IRC just to tell me how much they love the idea. Very awesome!
For October 1st, I‚Äôll be setting up and doing a new post on the Ludum Dare site, explaining how we can keep a list of finished games (i.</description>

      <description>You might think I‚Äôm contractually obligated to start something ridiculous every few years, though I don‚Äôt remember signing the papers.
My new project is awesome, I love it, but it‚Äôs going to take me all of next year (and maybe more) to make it. I‚Äôm so fascinated and taken by it, it‚Äôs something I NEED to make. But that‚Äôs next years agenda.
This year, 2010, there‚Äôs still a good 3 months left.</description>

      <description>And it‚Äôs that time again too. Ludum Dare #17 is coming up next weekend. If the idea of crunching together a game from scratch in 48 hours interests you, check us out.
Now, this compo has been a little different. We announced our date nice and early, so the people at GDC would know about it, and to save us from silly ‚Äúwhen will the compo be?‚Äù questions. So really, it was probably our best pre-announcement for a compo date to date.</description>

      <description>So, holy cow! GDC was absolutely insane! I almost don‚Äôt know where to start, but lets start from the beginning.
First thing first, I won again!!
Yes, as if winning a free car wasn‚Äôt enough, I also won a free trip to GDC. So Intel ended up covering my flight, putting me up in a fancy hotel, gave me some spending money, treating me to dinner, AND giving me nearly front row seats to a San Jose Sharks hockey game!</description>

      <description>For the benefit of friends and people I‚Äôm meeting at the show, here‚Äôs a run down of my itinerary for GDC. I‚Äôll also be tweeting and watching twitter while I‚Äôm down for any impromptu meets, hang-outs, and whatever with people I know. If the twitter says ‚Äútotally bored‚Äù, then you know. üôÇ
If anybody I know needs my cell number, send me a quick e-mail (mike AT sykhronics dot com). It‚Äôs not my usual cell, but it‚Äôll be my number whilst I‚Äôm in San Fran.</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2010/03/04/personalizing-your-gdc-pass/</guid>
      <description>Ordinarily, greeting someone by glancing at their chest might be seen as a little rude (especially a lady), but at GDC it‚Äôs encouraged! Yes I‚Äôm talking about the passes, not making a pass.
The passes do a good job of helping you connect a face to a name, and even a company, but you don‚Äôt always know who made or represents what. GDC passes include a relatively large pocket, so you could either make something to insert behind your name card, or cover the pass with some strategically placed stickers.</description>

      <description>So last year, I was an IGF Mobile finalist. This little game of mine stood alongside iPhone favorites like Edge and Fieldrunners, vying for the ‚ÄúBest Mobile Game‚Äù award. And if I had won, ‚Ä¶ well, I have no idea. Even just being a finalist has been great for me, so I‚Äôd image it would have been MORE great. üòâ
That was 2009, and this is 2010.
This year started out as my ‚Äúlow key‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù GDC.</description>

      <description>So wow. That‚Äôs finally it for 2009. Like doing taxes ever year, I feel a special sort of obligation that I write some sort of retrospective, especially after such an eventful year as this one. Far more awesome than taxes. üòâ
I wasn‚Äôt sure where to start, so I ended up categorizing aspects of the year. I‚Äôll free form rant about each topic as I come to it.
Let‚Äôs begin.</description>

      <description>Wow. To say the last 3 weeks have been busy would be an understatement.
First of all, I ported Smiles to a new phone. The Samsung Omnia II, a Windows Mobile phone with a beautiful amoled screen and a custom GPU. Some photos.
For those keeping score, the game unfortunately runs a little slow on the Omnia II. It‚Äôs definitely playable, but the GPU is no PowerVR SGX. I did what I could in the time I had, optimized my shaders and all that, but it‚Äôs what it is.</description>

      <title>Ludum Dare 16 Announcement</title>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2009/11/13/ludum-dare-16-announcement/</guid>
      <description>Today we announced the date for Ludum Dare #16. This upcoming December 11th-13th weekend.
Ludum Dare is that other thing I do. Along with Phil, Mike and Seth, we run a community website based around the infamous Ludum Dare competition. Game developers from around the world assemble, pick a theme, and make a game from scratch over the weekend. Then we vote on our favorites.

Nowadays, we do it 3 times per year, this one being our regular December competition.</description>

      <description>Wow!
Ludum Dare #14‚Äôs 123 entries in April was a pretty big deal, but our 15th Ludum Dare in August did a whopping 144! Yikes!
http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview
On the plus side, Phil and I came together and awesome-ified the website. He wrote our all new voting and submission system, and I made the site look new and purty. And when all was said and done, it actually worked! Wow!
It came together the weekend before the competition.</description>

      <title>A trailer and a compo</title>

      <description>Yes yes, I‚Äôm awfully quiet. What else is new?
Let me tell you.
First things first, a brand new trailer for Smiles.
Why does Smiles need a new trailer? I‚Äôll tell you when you‚Äôre older.
This ended up taking a couple weeks longer than I‚Äôd hoped it would (spontaneous summer vacation?), but it‚Äôs done. The new trailer combines the tidbits dropped in the last post (mushroom animation, new logo), some gameplay footage, and a nice audio track.</description>

      <description>Crawling out of bed early this morning, I made the weird decision that it‚Äôd be a blogging morning. It seems I‚Äôve stockpiled a few interesting things to talk about. I‚Äôm nearly ready to start talking about the new project too, but as the title suggests, I‚Äôll be talking about the other stuff today.
First thing on the agenda, Ludum Dare. I wanted to follow up that prior post of mine with a brief finale post.</description>

      <description>Wow!
So, I have no idea what just happened, but Ludum Dare 14 was our biggest yet. With 121 entries from around the world, that‚Äôs a-lot!!
From my quick check, the highest we‚Äôve had to date was high 60‚Äôs (though I was pretty sure we did an 80 entry compo at one point). *shrugs*
I started on an entry on Saturday, but didn‚Äôt get all that far. Friday (besides taxes), I was caught up administrating, making sure the whole thing actually happened.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note.
Ludum Dare 14 is this Friday. It‚Äôs usually Phil and I that run the compo (with Mike and Seth, and our awesome community of regulars), but IGF Champion and Goat Owner Extreme Phil Hassey is off on his North American Tour next week, leaving me to see if I can remember how to use all his compo scripts. üòâ
If you‚Äôre not familiar with Ludum Dare, we‚Äôre probably the oldest make a game in 48 hours competitions on the internet.</description>

      <title>Smile Zen and Drop Available, News</title>

      <description>It‚Äôs been 2 weeks, and much has happened.
As the topic suggests, Smiles Drop and Smiles Zen are now both available. $2.99 each, or save $1 by getting Smiles ($4.99).
So yeah, in a way that means I technically have 3 games out. As for blog content, I‚Äôm half way through a post on what went in to creating the video. Actually I was half through the Friday of the last post, but got caught up in the fact that I could actually take it easy for a couple days‚Ä¶ and I sorta haven‚Äôt gone back to finish the post yet.</description>

      <description>Still doin‚Äô the perpetual ‚Äúone more week‚Äù, but I‚Äôm close. Very close. If things go according to plan, we‚Äôll be beta next Monday (September 1st). I want to sit on it a couple days and test the crap out of it, just to be sure it‚Äôs all good. Then off to Apple by Wednesday-Friday.
I wanted the promo+box art done a couple weeks ago, but I amusingly keep pushing it back.</description>

      <description>Slightly off topic today. Well, if you‚Äôre expecting mystery iPhone game news that is.
The weekend ended up being a little more slack-tastic that I‚Äôd hoped. Ludum Dare 12 after all, which always keeps me busy.
With only a couple hours left, I decided I‚Äôd throw something together quickly. Well, those couple hours went very well.
With so little time, I obviously couldn‚Äôt make anything extravagant. What I ended up with was a game best described as ‚Äúa game designed to piss you off‚Äú.</description>

      <description>Avert your eyes. Nothing to see here. Move along. I‚Äôm going to stop pretending I know when I‚Äôm ready to show. I‚Äôve done several prototypes lately, but I‚Äôd rather talk about them with some context of what they lead up to.
So‚Ä¶ maybe July. *sigh*
Oh, and Ludum Dare 12 will be August 8th weekend. Be there. </description>

      <description>I was really hoping to show what I‚Äôve been up to these past couple months right about now, but it looks like that tease will have wait a few more weeks.
Something that is ready to go, albeit beta like, is the new Ludum Dare website.
http://www.ludumdare.com
The WordPress blog we‚Äôve used for the last 2 compos has been migrated to dedicated hosting, and the ludumdare.com domain now points to it directly.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôll get back to the series eventually. I was expecting to work and talk about new engine stuffs. Between some spontaneous stuff, taxes, and a week of illness, I‚Äôve not touched anything ‚Äúnext‚Äù since early last month.
In other news, Ludum Dare 11 is this Friday. I‚Äôve been too busy to really get involved, but Phil‚Äôs got things under control. Notice went out to the mailing list a good month or so early, and I‚Äôve been mirroring the posts on a very default looking gamecompo.</description>

      <description>Start the year right ‚Äòeh?
I think each year I‚Äôve had a blog, I‚Äôve told myself ‚ÄúYes sir! This year we‚Äôre going to blog more often‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs going to be great!‚Äù.
I‚Äôm not crazy enough to think that‚Äôs going to happen, but there‚Äôs always the intent. ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
Some fun code I toyed with over the past couple weeks, completely unrelated to each other. The VST SDK (audio instrument/effects) and the WinTab SDK (tablets).</description>

      <description>Ludum Dare #10, December 14th-16th 2007. Make a game in 48 hours.
Updated rules, after all these years. If Geoff doesn‚Äôt have the site functional by the start time, Phil Hassey‚Äôs hosting. For the latest, see:

      <description>The compo is going ahead full force, despite our complete lack of publicity and organization.
The theme is ‚ÄúBuild the Level You Play‚Äú. In other words, design a game leveraging user creation or user created content, or a game of building. Line Rider, PuffBOMB, The Incredible Machine, and much more. We‚Äôve seen some pretty exciting ideas discussed in IRC, so don‚Äôt miss out.

      <description>Yep. It‚Äôs coming. Beyond suggesting the date, I‚Äôve been too busy to get really involved, but it‚Äôs coming. This might be one of the most last minute LD‚Äôs in a couple years, but it should come together.
After all, it‚Äôs an April tradition. Visit us on irc.afternet.org in #ludumdare, and start some fires, and help us get things moving.
The mailing list is still there, though the website is down. I‚Äôm in the middle of splitting my websites between personal and business on to 2 separate hosts, gamecompo.</description>
