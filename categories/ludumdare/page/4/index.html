    <h2>Getting Close</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Still doin’ the perpetual “one more week”, but I’m close. Very close. If things go according to plan, we’ll be beta next Monday (September 1st). I want to sit on it a couple days and test the crap out of it, just to be sure it’s all good. Then off to Apple by Wednesday-Friday.
I wanted the promo&#43;box art done a couple weeks ago, but I amusingly keep pushing it back....</p>

    <h2>I make games to piss you off</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Slightly off topic today. Well, if you’re expecting mystery iPhone game news that is.
The weekend ended up being a little more slack-tastic that I’d hoped. Ludum Dare 12 after all, which always keeps me busy.
With only a couple hours left, I decided I’d throw something together quickly. Well, those couple hours went very well.
With so little time, I obviously couldn’t make anything extravagant. What I ended up with was a game best described as “a game designed to piss you off“....</p>

    <p>Avert your eyes. Nothing to see here. Move along. I’m going to stop pretending I know when I’m ready to show. I’ve done several prototypes lately, but I’d rather talk about them with some context of what they lead up to.
So… maybe July. *sigh*
Oh, and Ludum Dare 12 will be August 8th weekend. Be there. ...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I was really hoping to show what I’ve been up to these past couple months right about now, but it looks like that tease will have wait a few more weeks.
Something that is ready to go, albeit beta like, is the new Ludum Dare website.
http://www.ludumdare.com
The WordPress blog we’ve used for the last 2 compos has been migrated to dedicated hosting, and the ludumdare.com domain now points to it directly....</p>

    <p>I’ll get back to the series eventually. I was expecting to work and talk about new engine stuffs. Between some spontaneous stuff, taxes, and a week of illness, I’ve not touched anything “next” since early last month.
In other news, Ludum Dare 11 is this Friday. I’ve been too busy to really get involved, but Phil’s got things under control. Notice went out to the mailing list a good month or so early, and I’ve been mirroring the posts on a very default looking gamecompo....</p>

    <p>Start the year right ‘eh?
I think each year I’ve had a blog, I’ve told myself “Yes sir! This year we’re going to blog more often… and it’s going to be great!”.
I’m not crazy enough to think that’s going to happen, but there’s always the intent. – – – –
Some fun code I toyed with over the past couple weeks, completely unrelated to each other. The VST SDK (audio instrument/effects) and the WinTab SDK (tablets)....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>The compo is going ahead full force, despite our complete lack of publicity and organization.
The theme is “Build the Level You Play“. In other words, design a game leveraging user creation or user created content, or a game of building. Line Rider, PuffBOMB, The Incredible Machine, and much more. We’ve seen some pretty exciting ideas discussed in IRC, so don’t miss out.

    <p>Yep. It’s coming. Beyond suggesting the date, I’ve been too busy to get really involved, but it’s coming. This might be one of the most last minute LD’s in a couple years, but it should come together.
After all, it’s an April tradition. Visit us on irc.afternet.org in #ludumdare, and start some fires, and help us get things moving.
The mailing list is still there, though the website is down. I’m in the middle of splitting my websites between personal and business on to 2 separate hosts, gamecompo....</p>

    <h2>Warmup Ludum Dare Compo 2007 &amp;#8211; Jan 26-28</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>This is a reprint of what hit the mailing list yesterday.

Hey,
On the weekend of Jan 26-28 there will be an unofficial Ludum Dare warmup competition.
The compo will be held entirely in #ludumdare on irc.afternet.org. Final entries must be hosted on your own web space. Someone might put up a wiki, but that someone won’t be me – Theme choice will be discussed and voted on Jan 26 at 7pm PST....</p>
