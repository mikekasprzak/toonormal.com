    <p>Most people don‚Äôt know we have a blog syndication sub-site on Ludum Dare called the Ludum Dare Planet. It‚Äôs an extra WordPress blog and site that eats very few resources, but still needs to be regularly updated.

    <p>Time to start the year right. After much folley and a good chunk of contract work last year, I started working on a new project. Some of the early-most efforts can be seen in the Quack tech demo video. No gameplay to see there, but you can see one of my prouder achievements in action: Live Coding/Live Content. Change a source file or an asset, and it updates in game immediately....</p>

    <h2>Nook and Emscripten: A technical look at C&#43;&#43; GameDev in the Browser</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I run an online game-jam event called Ludum Dare, and this past weekend I got together with a friend (Derek Laufman of Halfbot) and we made a game. What did we make? A platformer about size.
The game was created over a period 72 hours. Somehow, amazing to me, we managed to pull it together despite our responsibilities.
 Me running the event (Ludum Dare) Family gathering at my brothers I attended on the Saturday Car appointment on Monday Derek taking care of his baby  Fortunately, running Ludum Dare is only busy for me before the event, and at submission time (two of them, 3-5 hours each). During the event I‚Äôm free to sit down and do whatever I want. This weekend was the Diablo 3 beta test, and if I was a lesser man, I‚Äôd have played that. Fortunately for me, Derek came to me a couple weeks ago and suggested we make a game together, I said yes, and the rest is history.
It‚Äôs totally silly, but I‚Äôm actually proud of the fact that I managed to attend the family gathering and the car appointment. Stupid me, I could have actually cancelled/rescheduled the appointment for Tuesday or Wednesday, but I decided to go ahead with it anyway. The car appointment was my yearly service for my smartcar, and I ended up staying in the neighborhood of the dealership for about 5 hours of that day. Working on my Ludum Dare game on my laptop, I had WIFI at the dealership, and also McDonalds, where I parked myself for a couple hours. To be honest, this was probably the first time I seriously ‚ÄúCoffee Shop Developed‚Äù, and where I actually got some serious work done. It was fun, because it was out of the ordinary. üôÇ
Anyways, that‚Äôs enough back story. Lets get nerdy.

    <p>I wont talk too much about how Ludum Dare itself went, as I‚Äôve already done that over here.
But in addition to running the event, I participated for the first time in a long time. The theme was ‚ÄúAlone‚Äú, which I find funny given the title of my game. Could I not enter? üòâ
About a week before Ludum Dare, I started toying with the idea of creating a demake of my game....</p>

    <h2>Conversation: Business and Fear</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures....</p>
