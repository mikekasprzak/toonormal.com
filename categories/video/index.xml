      <title>Quadruped Animation Test</title>

      <description>Yeah, the list of things needed to make that animation better are extensive (it‚Äôs so floaty). Still, first time I‚Äôve ever animated a quadruped, and first time I‚Äôve ever seriously animated something in Spine.</description>

      <description>A video demonstration of the tech behind my upcoming game code named #MRK. A look more at the fancy Live Coding features built in to the engine. Everything works so well, it can be used for very rapid iterative development. The program never stops, all asset and code files are automatically reloaded, and if used correctly game state will stay the same across reloads.
I‚Äôm hoping to do more videos as I introduce more general features, as well as when I have things to show in #MRK.</description>

      <description>Smiles has wrapped, so yes sir, I am working on my new game. Let the AWESOME begin!
Today I plowed through the massive task of finishing the redesign of my new build system, and moved the WIP game code over to it‚Äôs lovely new home. Lots of work, not much to show (at least, not in the mood to show yet).
But hey, I have this other thing.
Yesterday I received a Hydra motion controller from Razer in the mail.</description>

      <description>Here‚Äôs a couple videos from the series, some of the more odd things I‚Äôve posted.
The first is a response to a topic of inspiration posed by Andy Moore. I try to get out for walks as often as I can, and I bring with me a camera phone‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs what I see:
Next was something from this past weekend. I picked up an iCade, which is an arcade controller for an iPad, and I got it working with something NOT an iPad.</description>

However! All is not lost!

      <description>The latest in the world of Mike, I might win something again.
I‚Äôm less than an hour away from finding out if it‚Äôs true, so here‚Äôs me killing minutes as I wait.</description>

      <description>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures.</description>

      <description>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I‚Äôve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I‚Äôve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù.</description>

      <description>I did miss my June 23rd target date, but with good reason: I started on computer upgrades and setting up my new Laptop early. üòÄ
But yes, as you approach the end of something, there are always things you forget about that still need to be done.
Like this, a Computer and TV-System appropriate trailer for Smiles HD (i.e. without entire screen rotating):
As you can see, that is now done.</description>

      <description>Speaking of better, here‚Äôs the final gameplay trailer for Kindle Smiles:
That is submitted and in the queue now. Should be available in the Amazon Kindle store soon.
BONUS!
I recorded a brief ‚Äúmaking-of‚Äù video, showing how recording the footage for the above video would look.
Now that Smiles is finally winding down, I‚Äôm hoping to do more little things like this.</description>

      <description>To say 2010 has been a busy year would be an understatement.
While we were all waiting for Apple to confirm the existence of the iPad, I was busy tweaking, improving, and porting my game Smiles to a bunch of new platforms. The most significant port by far was to Netbook PCs for Intel‚Äôs AppUp Center, a brand new App Store coming soon to Netbooks everywhere.
To say Intel and AppUp have been good to me, that would be another understatement.</description>

      <guid>https://toonormal.com/2009/11/06/video-cross-promotion-in-smiles/</guid>
      <description>Here‚Äôs something I hope to start doing more often. Technically, I‚Äôve been hoping to actually start all year. Short development video logs.
Today‚Äôs video is a demonstration of the cross promotion features in Smiles Zen and Smiles Drop. Inspiration hit last night, and I added something amusing to it I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd share.
Both builds should go out tonight. I‚Äôll be adding a pair of arrows beside the icon, just so it‚Äôs even clearer that you can click on it right here.</description>

      <description>Yes yes, I‚Äôm awfully quiet. What else is new?
Let me tell you.
First things first, a brand new trailer for Smiles.
Why does Smiles need a new trailer? I‚Äôll tell you when you‚Äôre older.
This ended up taking a couple weeks longer than I‚Äôd hoped it would (spontaneous summer vacation?), but it‚Äôs done. The new trailer combines the tidbits dropped in the last post (mushroom animation, new logo), some gameplay footage, and a nice audio track.</description>

      <description>Been caught up with a number of things. Here‚Äôs one I‚Äôm rather proud of, an animated Smiles mushroom animation.
Click for 400k animated gif
Animated in ToonBoom Studio.
Something else, an updated Sykhronics Logo animation.
That one is me goofing off in Sony Vegas.
Fun fun.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm back. This time, I‚Äôm ready for GDC!
Come take an early look at the madness I‚Äôm bringing with me to the conference.
As you can probably guess from the lack of Smiles PC/HD progress posts, I will not be demoing it at the conference. I am still bringing both laptops though. The big one will be doing something else instead.
Enjoy! üôÇ</description>

      <description>Yet another series, but video.
Part 1 of hopefully a few videos of me showing off my IGF preparations. Sinage, computers, etc.
3 weeks left and counting.
A bit roughly put together, but that‚Äôs half the point. I didn‚Äôt want it to eat up that much time, though it did take me some time to remember how to edit and encode a video (without my software crashing).
It‚Äôs no Goo Road to the IGF, but hey.</description>

      <title>Physics in Smiles</title>

      <description>At first glance you wouldn‚Äôt think a matching game like Smiles would feature physics, but it does. In several places actually.
The most obvious example is the particle effects.
Particles were used when ice and rocks break, and also for the tile clearing effect. The tile would be erased instantly from the board, and a particle would be created in it‚Äôs place. The particle would zoom in, slow down, then zoom out with a twist.</description>

      <description>I kept video of some of my more interesting bugs/glitches/oddities in Smiles. Some more silly than others.
The first I want to show is a bug in one of the effects for the game mode Zen. It was supposed to be a ‚Äútoss a rock in to a pond‚Äù water ripple. It didn‚Äôt really work as expected.

Here‚Äôs what it was supposed to look like. Cool looking, but the problem with this was the effect would make you queasy.</description>

      <description>Final version of the Smiles video. It‚Äôs the short one again, but with me talking.
Here‚Äôs your chance to hear and mock Mike. I‚Äôve been getting a number of positive and amusing comments from the video. Such fun things as that I sound like an Infomercial host, and music sounds like ‚Äúcorporate training music‚Äù. Finishing this video has been an incredible hassle. Hard drives dying, frequent reboots, loss of WAV file playback in Windows, and YouTube difficulties.</description>

      <description>Yeah, sorry. I wanted to do detailed commentary of The Spider stuffs, the in between stuff, and get in to the new PuffBOMB stuff, but it looks like it didn‚Äôt happen. I wrote an outline and drafted a couple parts, but I wasn‚Äôt happy with the results.
‚ÄúNew PuffBOMB‚Äù has been down to just me since October. The artist finished his work, which turned out great. Richard got a job, and has been unavailable to help since.</description>

      <description>Before starting work on ‚ÄúThe Spider‚Äù, I was building the engine for the ‚Äúnew PuffBOMB‚Äù. The concept behind the engine, 2D characters and physics, 3D backgrounds styled to look 2D, HD ready. Pretty standard stuff.
The concept behind ‚ÄúThe Spider‚Äù is, unlike a normal platformer where you stand on the ground, this one you wouldn‚Äôt. Instead you would hang from and move along ceilings. The best idea I had at the time for pulling it off was something I nicknamed ‚Äúdouble ropes‚Äù, one to support, and one for action.</description>

      <description>Well, I‚Äôm not going to let the month go by without posting something. After all, I have been doing much stuff. Not so much round up, but many many other things.
The project progresses. We‚Äôre busy preparing a pitch-able playable of the game that we‚Äôll be pitchely pitching to potential pitch-able people pretty pitching soon. I‚Äôll have less riddles and more to say about that in a few weeks.
Also, I‚Äôve silently (and finally) put together a MacOS X version of PuffBOMB.</description>
