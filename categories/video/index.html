<p>Yeah, the list of things needed to make that animation better are extensive (it&rsquo;s so floaty). Still, first time I&rsquo;ve ever animated a quadruped, and first time I&rsquo;ve ever seriously animated something in Spine.</p>

    <p>A video demonstration of the tech behind my upcoming game code named #MRK. A look more at the fancy Live Coding features built in to the engine. Everything works so well, it can be used for very rapid iterative development. The program never stops, all asset and code files are automatically reloaded, and if used correctly game state will stay the same across reloads.
I‚Äôm hoping to do more videos as I introduce more general features, as well as when I have things to show in #MRK....</p>

    <p>Smiles has wrapped, so yes sir, I am working on my new game. Let the AWESOME begin!
Today I plowed through the massive task of finishing the redesign of my new build system, and moved the WIP game code over to it‚Äôs lovely new home. Lots of work, not much to show (at least, not in the mood to show yet).
But hey, I have this other thing.
Yesterday I received a Hydra motion controller from Razer in the mail....</p>

    <p>Here‚Äôs a couple videos from the series, some of the more odd things I‚Äôve posted.
The first is a response to a topic of inspiration posed by Andy Moore. I try to get out for walks as often as I can, and I bring with me a camera phone‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs what I see:
  Next was something from this past weekend. I picked up an iCade, which is an arcade controller for an iPad, and I got it working with something NOT an iPad....</p>

    <p>From Monday, Gianfranco (whom I abbreviate as GB) was concerned that some of the guys might have been fear-mongering after a recent set of very sad sad videos. That catapulted me in to a rant about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs actually that way. Indie truths a-plenty.
The first begins on the subject of ‚Äúbig games are extremely risky‚Äù, despite doing one myself right now.
  I had some upload issues with the prior video, which lead me to watching my video a few more times, and expanding on the subject of indies and failures....</p>

  <div class="entry-meta">

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Hello there! I figured now was a good time to talk about a project I‚Äôve been involved with for the past couple months now. Something we like to call, the Indie Indie Conversation. The conversation is a YouTube channel shared amongst a group of indie game developers where we talk about what we do, the challenges, and the lifestyle of creating games independently for a living.
I‚Äôve personally failed many attempts at starting a regular video log here on my blog, and in retrospect that may have been the uncomfortable feeling of ‚Äútalking to a wall‚Äù....</p>

    <p>I did miss my June 23rd target date, but with good reason: I started on computer upgrades and setting up my new Laptop early. üòÄ
But yes, as you approach the end of something, there are always things you forget about that still need to be done.
Like this, a Computer and TV-System appropriate trailer for Smiles HD (i.e. without entire screen rotating):
  As you can see, that is now done....</p>
