  <div class="post-content"><p>Hello! If you&rsquo;re here, you probably saw me mention that I&rsquo;ll be looking for work in 2017.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had to look for a job since 1999, so I don&rsquo;t have a resume/portfolio handy. If you follow my work, you&rsquo;ll know that I&rsquo;m very busy right now working on <strong>Ludum Dare</strong>, and I will be for the rest of the year. Formal stuff is going to have to wait until then.</p>
<p>But thanks to <strong>Ludum Dare</strong>, I know that a number of people do follow my work. So I wrote this to confirm that yes, I am looking for work, and give folks an opportunity to reach-out early. My apologies if I don&rsquo;t get back right away.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a brief post about myself. If you&rsquo;re feeling nosy, you can browse my public <a href="http://github.com/povrazor">GitHub</a> repo, or even <strong>this blog</strong>, but this blog is an anomaly (some parts a decade out of date).</p>
<p>These days my blog is more of a notebook; Collecting thoughts and details on topics I&rsquo;ve researched, so that I can more easily repeat them or pick-up where I left off.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludum_Dare">Ludum Dare</a>. I didn&rsquo;t start it, but I am its caretaker. I have been a part of it since the beginning (2002).</p>
<p>Besides that, starting in 1999 I worked for several game companies over the years (Sandbox Studios, Digital Illusions Canada, and Big Blue Bubble). I&rsquo;ve done contracting as well. I&rsquo;ve shipped more than a dozen commercial games (mostly licensed games, including a few more Barbie games than I&rsquo;d care to admit); Written lots of low-level C and C++ code for Nintendo and Sony consoles, and a few games entirely in Assembly. I&rsquo;ve also written lots of OpenGL, ES, and SDL code, shaders, and ported code to dozens of popular and exotic mobile and embedded platforms (most don&rsquo;t exist anymore). I can 3D math, build engines, assemble a toolchain, and wrangle my way through physics. I&rsquo;m formerly the Technical Director of a large Canadian game studio (Big Blue Bubble), and I ran a “financially underwhelming” indie studio for many years. That was until this side project of mine (Ludum Dare) became my focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m based in London Ontario Canada (yes, there&rsquo;s a London in Canada).</p>
<p>I enjoy doing low-level, performance, and optimization work. I&rsquo;m at-home on Linux, but spent many years on Windows using Cygwin. I&rsquo;m not a fan of “black boxes”. I like to know how everything works, and know exactly what to expect. Thanks to Ludum Dare, I also know a lot about PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Linux Servers, and all those trendy web technologies and standards that are all-the-rage. I like Vulkan and VR, but I haven&rsquo;t done anything real with them.</p>
<p>In my spare time (ha) I toy with a bunch of other projects. I like to dabble with Arduinos, Electronics, Retro Computers, exotic SBC&rsquo;s (Single Board Computers), and IOT devices. I get nerdy about getting the most out of the least expensive devices (the old cost vs power ratio), and I think eSports is cool (I used to be really in to Starcraft 2 and Smash).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty good cook too. 😀</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for something interesting. Not necessarily gamedev, but who knows. Something compatible with me having my own projects and commitments, like Ludum Dare. I can&rsquo;t relocate to the US, but I can visit (I have no diploma. I dropped out of college to take my first industry gig). I really don&rsquo;t know what options I have, but I&rsquo;ve done soooo much low level and backend work, that despite industry trends, taking a Unity gig just seems like a waste (I&rsquo;ve barely touched it, and I have “opinions” of C# 😉 ).</p>
<p>To summarize, I&rsquo;m looking for: “interesting”, “flexible”, and “not Unity”.</p>
<p>Still here? Want to tease me for being so picky? You can get in touch with me here: <a href="mailto:mike@sykhronics.com">mike@sykhronics.com</a></p>
