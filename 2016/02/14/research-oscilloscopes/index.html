  <div class="post-content"><p>So basically, this entire series of tool research posts is the result of me searching for an Oscilloscope, and then discovering my existing workflow was bad.</p>
<p>I’ve lost count at how many hours I’ve spent doing homework on low cost high value scopes. I’ve explored a variety of offerings from Siglent, Rigol, Owon, Uni-T, Hantek, and others, trying to find the best value. I don’t have the desk space for an old analog scope (which is a way to get a good scope for under $100). So I need a smaller digital scope to fit my setup.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to give each brand a fair shake, but in the end, all signs point to one.</p>
<h2 id="rigol-ds1054z">Rigol DS1054Z</h2>
<p>Cost: <strong>$399 US</strong></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>– 4 Channels (Bonus!)</p>
<p>– 50 MHz (software upgradable to 100 MHz)</p>
<p>– Integrated Help</p>
<p>– Pretty much everything you want</p>
<p>– Small</p>
<p>– Low price (given what it can do)</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>– One set of knobs shared amongst each channel (versus separate knobs per channel)</p>
<p>– Fan could be quieter</p>
<p>– Not-so-great FFT (no substitute for a spectrum analyser)</p>
<p>– Many built-in features cost extra *</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned EEVblog several times, a very picky experienced EE, and this is his recommended scope.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After much fuss, too much reading, I can’t seem to find a scope in this price range that does everything as well as this one, and that even ignores the fact that it has 4 channels. You get 4 channels! Everything else in the price range has 2. Madness!</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I’ve accepted there’s no other scope that even comes close. The only reason I haven’t purchased it, is that buying one will cost me about <strong>$650 CAD</strong>… which is a lot of money. Every non-oscilloscope device I’ve been researching costs under (or around) $100. $650 is a lot.</p>
<p>I’ve actually found cheaper scopes. Amazon.ca has a few Siglent scopes for just over $400 CAD, no tax (roughly $300 USD). I got real close to buying one, but ultimately stopped myself once I realized it wasn’t the latest Siglent model (those cost about $800 base). Then I learned about some of scopes that, for whatever reason, can be hacked to become better scopes.</p>
<p>Actually, I do have an Oscilloscope. A really basic one I picked up in 2009 called the DSO Nano.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I’ve never really used it seriously, but it’s not exactly the most useful oscilloscope. You can buy a DIY kit for about $20 that does basically the same thing.</p>
<p>So yeah, scopes. I know what I want, but now comes convincing myself to spend the money.</p>
