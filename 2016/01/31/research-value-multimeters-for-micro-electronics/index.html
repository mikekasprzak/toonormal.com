  <div class="post-content"><p>I did a bunch of homework on Multimeters. Here’s a good beginners guide.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here’s a more technical guide to buying a good meter.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There’s a ton of great information packed in that video, but unfortunately dude is an experienced no-compromise electrical engineer, so his minimum recommendations cost around $100. And actually, his advice is correct if you have any interest in doing any real electronics work (Cars, AC devices, or really anything more than microcontrollers).</p>
<p>But for me, I’m only really interested in micro electronics. Computers and small devices that draw around 5v or 3.3v (*maybe* as much as 12v), and only a few Amperes. I.e. things like the Raspbery Pi, Arduino’s, old PCs, old video game consoles, etc.</p>
<p>Pro gear is ideal, but I’m not a pro. I do electronics to learn, not to do anything important. Still, I highly recommend that video because it’s packed with experience.</p>
<p>In my research, I chose a Chinese manufacturer that EEVblog doesn’t like, mainly because they compromise (but when I get to talking about Power Supplies, you’ll see other manufacturers compromise WAY more). Again, this dude is a real engineer, and he needs a reliable device that can deal with high voltages (outside the scope of my hobby).</p>
<p>The devices I’ve chosen I believe are ideal for me, and are capable of some higher end work, with the understanding that <strong>extra care</strong> must be taken when dealing outside the 3.3-5v range, plugging in to the wall directly, etc.</p>
<h2 id="junk-device-generic-a830l">Junk Device: Generic A830L</h2>
<p>Cost: <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Modern-LCD-Digital-Multimeter-battery-Ammeter-Voltmeter-Ohmmeter-Current-Tester-Grey-White-Blue-Black-Sep02/32455581515.html"><strong>$3-$6</strong></a></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To be honest, the product code isn’t even that useful, but there a bunch to be found.</p>
<p>This meter is junk. It’s one of 2 meters that hover around the $3 price range. I’ve included it just to list the cons.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It beeps</li>
<li>Resistance tester</li>
<li>Diode tester</li>
<li>Transistor tester (hFE) *</li>
<li>Backlight *</li>
<li>Kickstand</li>
</ul>
<p>Only two (*) redeeming features, but that doesn’t mean they’re good.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Manual range!</li>
<li>Poor precision options</li>
<li>Combined Voltage and Ampere plug (Unsafe)</li>
<li>Manual hold button (not automatic, need a free hand to use it)</li>
<li>No Capacitor tester</li>
<li>No Oscillator tester</li>
<li>No Duty Cycle tester</li>
<li>No Temperature tester</li>
<li>Low quality connectors</li>
<li>Unfused 10A line</li>
<li>May have bad leads (order some <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Quality-1-Pair-Universal-Needle-Tip-Probe-Test-Leads-Pin-For-Digital-Multimeter-Meter-Tester/32383303198.html">better leads</a>)</li>
<li>4 digits of precision (????)</li>
<li>Kickstand might break</li>
<li>Don’t plug in to AC Mains</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly, you might spend more money on the 9V battery.</p>
<p>We can do better!!</p>
<h2 id="value-low-end-device-uni-t-ut-136b">Value Low End Device: UNI-T UT-136B</h2>
<p>Cost: <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/UNI-T-UT136B-Auto-Range-Digital-Multimeter-AC-DC-Frequency-Resistance-Tester-free-shipping/1926170184.html"><strong>~$16</strong></a></p>
<p>Manual: <a href="http://www.uni-trend.com/uploads/soft/wanyongbiao/UT136ABCD-Manual-en.pdf">http://www.uni-trend.com/uploads/soft/wanyongbiao/UT136ABCD-Manual-en.pdf</a></p>

<p>After doing my research, to me this appears to be the minimum quality meter you should own. I currently own 2 junk meters I bought from Radio Shack, and I’m pretty sure I spent $60+ on the one because it was “automatic”. What a difference a decade makes.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Separate Voltage and Ampere lines (Safety!)</li>
<li>Micro Ampere and Milliampere measurements</li>
<li>Automatic decimal place (manual isn’t cool)</li>
<li>Good+Fast beeper (lagged sound is really stupid)</li>
<li>Resistance tester</li>
<li>Diode tester</li>
<li>Capacitor tester</li>
<li>Oscillator Hz tester</li>
<li>Square Wave Duty Cycle tester</li>
<li>Some sort of Sine Wave feature (I forget why this is useful, maybe AC power *shrug*)</li>
<li>Fused 10A line</li>
<li>Kickstand…</li>
<li>Support for sleeved banana connectors on leads</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Manual hold button (not automatic, need a free hand to use)</li>
<li>Some Capacitor testers have a socket for caps, but not this one</li>
<li>Not the best quality banana connectors</li>
<li>May have bad leads (order some <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Quality-1-Pair-Universal-Needle-Tip-Probe-Test-Leads-Pin-For-Digital-Multimeter-Meter-Tester/32383303198.html">better leads</a>)</li>
<li>Fuses are not best quality</li>
<li>4 digits of precision (4000)</li>
<li>No transistor tester (not that important, but some devices do this)</li>
<li>Kickstand might break</li>
<li>No backlight</li>
<li>No Temperature tester (UT136C model replaces a feature with temperature)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a comparison versus a better meter, and while it’s not perfect, it does keep up where it counts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And more specific breakdown.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve ordered one of these. I think it’s adequate for my needs, but of course I want one of these:</p>
<h2 id="value-high-end-device-uni-t-ut-61e">Value High End Device: UNI-T UT-61E</h2>
<p>Cost: <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/UNI-T-UT-61E-UT61E-22-000-count-AC-DC-bench-Modern-meter-Digital-Multimeter-Volt/1926170329.html"><strong>~$47</strong></a></p>
<p>Manual: <a href="http://uni-trend.com/manual2/UT61English.pdf">http://uni-trend.com/manual2/UT61English.pdf</a></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It includes a few accessories.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Separate Voltage and Ampere lines (Safety!)</li>
<li>Micro Ampere and Milliampere measurements</li>
<li>Automatic display with voltage range graph (I forget the name)</li>
<li>5 digits of precision (22000)</li>
<li>6 second automatic hold (not truly automatic, but 6 seconds works)</li>
<li>Supports removing the delta of the lead resistance (RMS?)</li>
<li>Track and toggle the Peak (Min/Max) Levels</li>
<li>Good+Fast beeper (lagged sound is really stupid)</li>
<li>Resistance tester</li>
<li>Diode tester</li>
<li>Capacitor tester with socket accessory</li>
<li>Oscillator Hz tester</li>
<li>Square Wave Duty Cycle tester</li>
<li>PC Connectivity via SERIAL</li>
<li>Fused 10A line</li>
<li>Kickstand…</li>
<li>Support for sleeved banana connectors on leads</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It occasionally spikes (rarely)</li>
<li>May have bad leads (order some <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Quality-1-Pair-Universal-Needle-Tip-Probe-Test-Leads-Pin-For-Digital-Multimeter-Meter-Tester/32383303198.html">better leads</a>)</li>
<li>Fuses are better than the other model, but may not be the best</li>
<li>Not the best quality banana connectors</li>
<li>No transistor tester (not that important, but some devices do this)</li>
<li>Kickstand might break</li>
<li>No backlight</li>
<li>No Temperature tester (UT-61B and UT-61C models replaces features with temperature)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a very in-depth 4 part video series here that tests and even calibrates the device:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And a comparison of other meters in the same quality range (albeit higher cost).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s not his favourite, but admits that it’s ideal for what I describe as my usage scenario (plus it has very high resolution).</p>
<p>EEVblog hates it because of the quality compromises.</p>
<h2 id="anything-better">Anything better?</h2>
<p>A better device would have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backlight</li>
<li>Fast Display Refresh Rate</li>
<li>Good/Sharp Leads</li>
<li>Better Fuses</li>
<li>Better Banana Connectors</li>
<li>Rubberized Casing (to help when you drop on a hard surface)</li>
<li>Better accuracy and precision</li>
<li>Clean levels (no false spikes, likely a software bug)</li>
<li>Temperature tester</li>
<li>Safer lifetime on AC mains</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m nowhere near experienced enough to take advantage of a better meter though. Better stuff costs more (Over $100), and as a hobbiest, I don’t need it. Because I don’t have pro gear, there will be times I shouldn’t trust my meter (i.e. occasional spikes, get a 2nd opinion), but it will be more than enough for what I do.</p>
<p>From what I’ve seen, in the price range (~$50), there is nothing better.</p>
<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>
<p>At the time of this post I’ve ordered both the junk tester (A830L) and the UNI-T UT-136B. Why the junk? As a backup mainly (or worst case, parts). The meters I have today are really bad.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The Radio Shack meter, while automatic, is lacking a lot of useful features like a beeper. Even the junk meter has a beeper!</p>
<p>Some weeks ago I ordered one of those temperature guns (a cheap one), so I’m hoping that’s enough for temperature measurement.</p>
<p>Things from China take weeks, even months to arrive. It’s Chinese New Year, so there’s at least 2 extra weeks to wait, so I probably wont see any of this until mid to late March.</p>
<p>At this time I have *NOT* purchased the UNI-T UT-61E, but you might say it’s on my xmas list. 🙂</p>
