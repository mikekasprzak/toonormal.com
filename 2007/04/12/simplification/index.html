  <div class="post-content"><p>I think it&rsquo;s an important direction and discussion for game design. Sure, as a gamer, I can handle complicated control schemes. I&rsquo;ve done my time and held my own in hotkey crazy RTS&rsquo;s, twitch FPS&rsquo;s, and I can be pretty menacing in Tony Hawk. But most of these games aren&rsquo;t getting any easier. I don&rsquo;t even care to finish Tony Hawk&rsquo;s Project 8, or the Underground games, because the things you need to do at the end are ridiculous.</p>
<p>Some gamers like to mock Diablo because of it&rsquo;s insanely simple control scheme, even your mom can play it (mine does). I&rsquo;ve been in awe for a number of years by some of my <em>purist</em> friends and associates who wouldn&rsquo;t even justify it as an RPG for that very reason (reason 12 why genre&rsquo;s hurt designers). Then it seemed the world forgot. Some 9 years later, <a href="http://www.fatethegame.com">Fate</a> comes out. It plays just as well as it&rsquo;s inspiration, and it&rsquo;s more approachable. You can&rsquo;t say that for any games in between.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the game industry <em>hard on</em> for 3D graphics and difficulty is starting to calm it&rsquo;s ass down.</p>
<p>Actually, what happened instead was the polar opposite distinctly emerged. Casual games. Short, easy games you can play for hours, if they so compel you. AKA: Match 3&rsquo;s, stacking games, sorting games, and brick busters. Some of them <a href="http://cakemaniacs.blogspot.com/">look really nice</a>.</p>
<p>The Wii happened too. The <em>secret</em> theoretical solution to FPS&rsquo;s on the console, since we&rsquo;re apparently too ignorant to support mouse and keyboard. I don&rsquo;t know about other people, but for me the dust has certainly settled over the Wii. I still care for the platform for it&rsquo;s ideals of smaller fun games, but the novelty of motion control has worn off on me. Red Steel isn&rsquo;t an FPS, it&rsquo;s a free moving Rail Shooter. That&rsquo;s a heck of a lot more complicated to play than an FPS. Blast Factor for the PS3&rsquo;s use of motion control is just a stupid gimmick at best. Call of Duty or Far Cry on the Wii I hadn&rsquo;t had the chance to try yet, but I imagine the pointing box you need to restrict yourself to doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier than Mouse+Keyboard.</p>
<p>So as I see it, the problem isn&rsquo;t our joysticks, crappy motion sensors, mouse sensitivity, or lack of buttons. It&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;re not using them well enough. Many of the fondest memories of games many of us have are of game experiences full of simplifications. Pacman didn&rsquo;t have to spin or strafe turning a corner; Megaman didn&rsquo;t have to reload and find the rocket ammo to recharge his rockets; I didn&rsquo;t have to hit forward, back rolling down to forward, back again for 2 seconds, then forward and punch while holding the R trigger to throw Ryu&rsquo;s fireball; Or wait, there&rsquo;s a parachute button? And Scorpion&rsquo;s Fatality in MK1 was “block” and up twice. What other fatalities does anyone remember?</p>
<p>My mom, the typical hardcore casual gamer, should be able to pick up and play a perceptively intense action game, and she should be able to do some incredible things in it. There&rsquo;s a way out there she can play a Gunstar Heroes. And there&rsquo;s a reason out there why she&rsquo;d play it too, and it ain&rsquo;t pretty flowers and butterflies for graphics.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
