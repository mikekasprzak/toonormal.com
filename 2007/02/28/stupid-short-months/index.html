  <div class="post-content"><p>Sitting in the home office, doing taxes. I came to the realization that the it’s one of those silly short February’s, and I hadn’t posted anything this month. I’ve been doing good as far as posts, with at least 1 thing to say every month. It’d be a shame to break that nice consistent list of dates on the right.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Job postings work. We found somebody that seems perfect for the job below. Just waiting on paperwork.</p>
<p>My PC wasn’t playing nice with DRM’d software (Audition, Colossus, …). I was also having odd issues with my DVD Burner, and my HP scanner was too fat (physically, and driver wise… 200 MB for a driver!?!).</p>
<p>I’m declaring it. That’s the last ASUS and HP product I buy.</p>
<p>So a couple weeks back, I went from a dual core Athlon, to a Quad core Intel. And instead of an ASUS, I went with an eVGA board. It’s an NVidia spec board, no stupid ASUS thinking they’re better designers garbage. Also, a USB powered Canon scanner. Ahh… the driver is a nice light 11 MB. Yes, 11 MB is “light” by today’s standards.</p>
<p>Also, of some interest, I’m now running Windows XP 64. Short of some printer problems, and MinGW’s BASH not working, it’s great. For the next month or so, you can buy a Windows XP and get a … uh … somewhat free upgrade to Vista. A $30 shipping style free upgrade, but it’s something. And yes, 64bit Windows XP gets you Vista 64 Biz. I’ll be waiting on installing it for a while, since not all my software is Vista friendly yet.</p>
<p>Oh and speaking of printer problems, while looking for replacement toner, I noticed it was actually cheaper to buy a new laser printer than to buy the toner ($99 printer, $105 toner). However, Future Shop’s lovely website had some refurbished Network Color Laser’s on for $250 ($300 off). What was I to do?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>[PRINTER and SERVER IMAGE]</p>
<p>Yikes. Konica Minolta 5430 DL.</p>
<p>I kinda wish it had a duplexer, but that stupid page flipping device costs over $300. That’s more than I paid for the printer! It also takes DIMM socketed memories, so we nearly upgraded it, though it didn’t like the PC-100, PC-133 and other sticks I had sitting around. A shame. It works beautifully with XP 64.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>On topic, we put together a trailer/presentation, and playable last month, for “I wont say what”.</p>
<p>I suppose there was also some really crappy family news, but I wont go in to that. I am happy though, she got to see the trailer/presentation before she passed.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The next few months should be big. Stay tuned. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
