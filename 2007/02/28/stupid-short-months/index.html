  <div class="post-content"><p>Sitting in the home office, doing taxes. I came to the realization that the it&rsquo;s one of those silly short February&rsquo;s, and I hadn&rsquo;t posted anything this month. I&rsquo;ve been doing good as far as posts, with at least 1 thing to say every month. It&rsquo;d be a shame to break that nice consistent list of dates on the right.  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Job postings work. We found somebody that seems perfect for the job below. Just waiting on paperwork.</p>
<p>My PC wasn&rsquo;t playing nice with DRM&rsquo;d software (Audition, Colossus, &hellip;). I was also having odd issues with my DVD Burner, and my HP scanner was too fat (physically, and driver wise&hellip; 200 MB for a driver!?!).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m declaring it. That&rsquo;s the last ASUS and HP product I buy.</p>
<p>So a couple weeks back, I went from a dual core Athlon, to a Quad core Intel. And instead of an ASUS, I went with an eVGA board. It&rsquo;s an NVidia spec board, no stupid ASUS thinking they&rsquo;re better designers garbage. Also, a USB powered Canon scanner. Ahh&hellip; the driver is a nice light 11 MB. Yes, 11 MB is “light” by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>Also, of some interest, I&rsquo;m now running Windows XP 64. Short of some printer problems, and MinGW&rsquo;s BASH not working, it&rsquo;s great. For the next month or so, you can buy a Windows XP and get a &hellip; uh &hellip; somewhat free upgrade to Vista. A $30 shipping style free upgrade, but it&rsquo;s something. And yes, 64bit Windows XP gets you Vista 64 Biz. I&rsquo;ll be waiting on installing it for a while, since not all my software is Vista friendly yet.</p>
<p>Oh and speaking of printer problems, while looking for replacement toner, I noticed it was actually cheaper to buy a new laser printer than to buy the toner ($99 printer, $105 toner). However, Future Shop&rsquo;s lovely website had some refurbished Network Color Laser&rsquo;s on for $250 ($300 off). What was I to do?  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>[PRINTER and SERVER IMAGE]</p>
<p>Yikes. Konica Minolta 5430 DL.</p>
<p>I kinda wish it had a duplexer, but that stupid page flipping device costs over $300. That&rsquo;s more than I paid for the printer! It also takes DIMM socketed memories, so we nearly upgraded it, though it didn&rsquo;t like the PC-100, PC-133 and other sticks I had sitting around. A shame. It works beautifully with XP 64.  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>On topic, we put together a trailer/presentation, and playable last month, for “I wont say what”.</p>
<p>I suppose there was also some really crappy family news, but I wont go in to that. I am happy though, she got to see the trailer/presentation before she passed.  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The next few months should be big. Stay tuned. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
