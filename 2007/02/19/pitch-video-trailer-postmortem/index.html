  <div class="post-content"><p>I was busy last month cutting together a trailer for&hellip; business purposes. I&rsquo;ll talk more about this later. It turned out surprisingly more difficult that I had have hoped, but I found a rather unique way of pulling it together.</p>
<p>Obviously, the secret weapon is Fraps. Trying to nab constant 60fps footage was doable, but proved tricky, due to my hard drives not being the most defragged. I don&rsquo;t know how many takes later, I ended up with nearly an hour of game footage, that was cut down to a 4 minute presentation.</p>
<p>Then I found myself in Virtual Dub, non destructively clipping my clips down to size.</p>
<p>Did my usual thang in Audition, recording a nice, friendly, albeit rushed narrative for the presentation.</p>
<p>But then came the real trouble. Assembling.</p>
<p>Just about every app I tried had some huge problem. Avid, Premier, MS Movie Maker, T@B Zweistein, and a list of open source ones. If it wasn&rsquo;t resolution limits, it was framerate caps, inability to read my files, etc.</p>
<p>In the end, I found a lovely, relatively unrestricted shareware program called, can you believe it, “Video Edit Magic”! And it was. Relatively stable (I didn&rsquo;t lose anything the 1 time it crashed). Simple. And only $70. It was well worth it, certainly saving my butt.</p>
