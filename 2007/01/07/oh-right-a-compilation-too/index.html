<p>It seems I missed the memo.</p>
<p>The 2nd <em>Independent Games</em> compilation <a href="http://www.amazon.com/IG-Independent-Games-V-2-0/dp/B000IN4VC2/ref=pd_bxgy_vg_text_b/105-5213483-4312439">was released</a> back in September (25th), and that PuffBOMB game I seem to talk about all the time was included.</p>
<p>As well, there was a set of concept art included in the package. Said art can also be seen <a href="/2006/07/22/puffbomb-concept-art-2003-2004/">right here</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose I should go find a way to acquire a copy, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m not sure what happened to a complimentary one.</p>
<p>And in other news&hellip; I&rsquo;m adding another sentence to this post so to not screw up the formating, thanks to my overly large image. Mission accomplished.</p>
