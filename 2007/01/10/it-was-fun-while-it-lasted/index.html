  <div class="post-content"><p>I like <a href="http://www.slamdance.com/games/">Slamdance</a>. I entered PuffBOMB last year, and was <a href="/2005/12/17/slamdance-2006-casual-finalist/">a finalist</a> for the casual game award. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been excited that a more “artful” game competition was beginning to take off. Winners receive a funky ugly dog statuette. Cool!  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Then a <a href="http://www.watercoolergames.org/archives/000717.shtml">controversial game was pulled</a>. Things are <a href="http://www.watercoolergames.org/archives/000719.shtml">not going well</a> now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real shame, and I hope something good comes from the controversy, rather than developing in to more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Thompson_(attorney)">Jack Thompson</a> style heat for our industry. The situation is all bad, no matter how many games pull out or stay in. I don&rsquo;t even think Slamdance changing their minds would help at this point, regardless of the <a href="http://grandtextauto.gatech.edu/2007/01/08/from-slamdance-games-finalists/">intentions of the letter</a>.</p>
<p>I could and would really like to go off more on this, but I can&rsquo;t afford to. I&rsquo;ll be cheering and booing from the sidelines. Go team!</p>
