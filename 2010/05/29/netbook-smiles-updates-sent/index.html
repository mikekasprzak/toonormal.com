<p>I have 1 last mobile port I‚Äôm doing, Samsung Bada. Again, Google wont let Canadians make Google Checkout Merchant accounts, so Android and NACL Smiles ports will be pending that, and a good motivator for each. I‚Äôm hoping to be finished with the Bada port in a few days, but we‚Äôll see. The OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering branch is prepped and totally ready for Sammy.</p>
<p>Then, at last, the <strong>Mystery Platform</strong> port.</p>
<p><strong>Mystery Platform</strong> requires numerous changes and additions to meet my needs, and the needs of the platform holder. It‚Äôs certainly the most work of all the ports. But the platform is totally awesome, hence all the emphasis as a <em>mystery</em>. I‚Äôm very excited about it. üôÇ</p>
<p>My plan initially was to try crunching it together in a month (June), but I think I‚Äôm going to take it easy, and also start on the ground-work for the new projects (i.e. adding library features, cleaning up my UI code, fixing my broken 3D code, making some tools?, etc). I will be using Smiles and the <strong>Mystery Platform</strong> port as a test-bed and reference for the refactoring I‚Äôm doing, but I expect myself to jump back and forth between non-Smiles tests in the process. By the end of the summer, I want Smiles for <strong>Mystery Platform</strong> done and out, and to be totally ready to seriously start the next project.</p>
<p>Anyways, it‚Äôs time to go erase 2 more items off my whiteboard. üôÇ</p>
