  <div class="post-content"><p>I have a goal of switching my focus entirely to a new project starting in July, which is about 6 weeks away. My 30th birthday is the 6th, so my folks have been joking that&rsquo;ll be my gift to myself. Happy Birthday Mike, you can do something else now&hellip; heh.</p>
<p>So to make that happen, I need to power through my list of pending platforms I want to cover, before back-burner&rsquo;ing the rest.</p>
<p>Yesterday (between a lunch outing with the folks, and Iron Man 2) I finally sat down and got the Mac port of Smiles up and running.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="http://www.galcon.com">Phil</a> had a few tips for me to make the distribution process go smoother, so it has an icon, bundled frameworks and so on now. In theory I could package up and distribute the game now, assuming I felt it was ready. I have a list of PC/Mac/Linux centric features I want in first, that conveniently Netbooks don&rsquo;t need. As-is, the i386 port is fully functional, but the x86-64 crashes. I could just gut the 64bit branch, but I&rsquo;m admittedly intrigued by the fact that a 64bit port is nearly working. I&rsquo;m going to need that on Linux proper, so I think I&rsquo;m going to keep it as a reference build. PPC, I just haven&rsquo;t tested yet. It&rsquo;s in the tree, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it (in either Rosetta or the real thing). I&rsquo;m almost 100% sure I have endian-ness issues somewhere.</p>
<p>I took a brief tangent the other day porting Smiles to the recently released <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/"><strong>NativeClient SDK</strong></a>. That involved porting/fixing my shader based OpenGL 2.0 renderer branch, which now works OpenGL 2.0 and ES 2.0 style. As for the NaCL port, after some effort it does compile, but a few restrictions of the platform had me back-burner it. I rely on Unix style directory searching (or Windows style on Windows and Windows Mobile). That apparently doesn&rsquo;t work yet (or wont?). I have a some things in place to allow me to generate a directory listing, and read it from a file, but the next problem convinced me to wait. Also, I&rsquo;ll have switch my file reading code to pull data from URL&rsquo;s instead of the local file system. All my file-io code is already wrapped, so this isn&rsquo;t too hard to do, but admittedly I wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to get this up and running.</p>
<p><strong>NativeClient</strong> is a <em>very cool</em> target platform with a lot of potential. I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;ll be how you develop native applications for Chromium OS, but if plugin adoption grows, it&rsquo;ll be an excellent way to do online game demos for PC/Mac/Linux. It compiles native binaries per CPU architecture (Currently just x86 and x86-64, but there&rsquo;s an ARM branch), it features OpenGL ES 2.0, and an interface for streaming audio&hellip; pretty much everything you need. The first (new) release was a little rough in the testing area, so I&rsquo;ll probably take a look at it again after another release or two.</p>
<p>The bulk of the past week and a bit has been learning the ins and outs of Linux installers (DEBs and RPMs). I had a rough couple days trying to get <a href="http://moblin.org/projects/moblin-package-creator">Moblin Package Creator</a> to do the work for me, but I don&rsquo;t use AutoConf/Configure or any of that stuff (too messy). My ‚Äúsavior‚Äù was a oddly named tool named ‚Äúcheckinstall‚Äù, which tracks all the files you create during a ‚Äúmake install‚Äù stage, and builds a DEB or RPM containing everything it saw you do. Easy.</p>
<p>That worked great for me, but checkinstall seems to be lacking some details found in RPM&rsquo;s. So I ended up capturing the generated spec-file used to generate the RPM, and invoking/building it manually (RPMBuild) with my changes. Technically I don&rsquo;t need checkinstall&rsquo;s tracking feature, but it&rsquo;s nice. I&rsquo;m generate the file list for RPMBuild with my tools.</p>
<p>So with that, I now have proper DEB and RPM installers. All that&rsquo;s left is getting the icons and symlinks in the right places for each installer format. That&rsquo;s it. I suppose I could have finished that by now, but I needed to get my head out of Linux for a day or so. üôÇ</p>
<p>My AppUp update for Windows is just pending the Linux/Moblin port. I wanted to be sure there wasn&rsquo;t anything new/changed before shipping the Moblin version.</p>
<p>After that, I have 2 more minor ports I&rsquo;m looking to get together before the end of the month. I&rsquo;ll talk more about them if (and when) I finish.</p>
<p>If everything goes according to plan, we begin the final hoo-rah for Smiles in June. The <strong><em>Mystery Platform</em></strong> port. It&rsquo;s big, and I&rsquo;ve been putting it off for far too long. That&rsquo;s my June. We&rsquo;ll see if <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/">E3</a> changes anything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The PC/Mac/Linux proper versions of Smiles HD, for my own sanity, will be delayed a bit. The follow up project I&rsquo;m planning for the summer I&rsquo;m expecting to only take a few months, so I&rsquo;ve decided to use that as my catalyst for setting up my store. That store should launch with PC/Mac/Linux versions of my new game, and Smiles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the plan. Always subject to change, but hey, that&rsquo;s where my head is at right now.</p>
