RealVNC has a rotating twitter quotes on their front page, and it seems I&rsquo;m now part of the rotation.
And yes, that is a real quote; I do think VNC is awesome. Admittedly, I&rsquo;ve been using UltraVNC on my PC&rsquo;s recently, though I do run their iPhone client. üòâ
Thanks for the tip Adam.">

<p>Moblin 2.1 running on the USB key</p>
<p>I <em><em>FINALLY</em></em> submitted my <a href="http://www.moblin.org">Moblin</a> (Linux) AppUp port of Smiles late last night. I planned on having this done a week or two ago, but between other things and some hardware I had to pick up (more USB keys), I still had a bunch to learn about Linux itself. I&rsquo;ve had my game code running on Linux since the beginning (I needed it, since my laptop was a Acer Aspire One Netbook running Linpus), but creating a proper RPM and DEB bundle for distribution was something I never tackled. Heck, I didn&rsquo;t even know where to put my files. üòâ</p>
<p>So with the installer hurdle out of the way, all that&rsquo;s left in the land of Linux is to tackle 64bit binaries. What Moblin provides is a pretty good <a href="http://moblin.org/projects/moblin-sdk-tools-and-toolchain">baseline GCC+Libraries collection</a>, that should be compatible with any notable 32bit distros out there today. I ran in to issues running the Ubuntu 10 compiled binary on Moblin, but the GCC version and libraries included in the <a href="http://moblin.org/projects/moblin-sdk-tools-and-toolchain">Moblin SDK</a> worked well across both. For the future, I need to find a good baseline 64bit Linux for creating my 64bit binaries. It&rsquo;s not something I can do right now (not comfortably), since my test machines (older Atom Netbooks) don&rsquo;t support 64bit instructions. I think the newer Atom chips might, so I&rsquo;ll have to grab one of those some day.</p>
<p>Next on the agenda is my update for Windows AppUp. With 1.0 I neglected to add my game to the Vista/7 game launcher. I figured out how to do it last time, but the game had a startup bug from the launcher I was trying to avoid, so I pulled it. Also there was a metadata XML file that Microsoft suggests you create, and I really wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to write it. I&rsquo;m not vying for a Microsoft ‚ÄúGames For Windows‚Äù certification right now, so I&rsquo;ll probably ignore that metadata file again, but this time I&rsquo;ll at least add myself to the game launcher (now that my bug is fixed).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll do for now. Really, I just wanted to post the weird discovery of me on the RealVNC website. üôÇ</p>
