  <div class="post-content"><p>I wont pretend this blog features much quality content, but it seems I&rsquo;ve been filling it with nonsense for 5 years now (started May 1st 2005). So wow!</p>
<p>Completely unrelated, yet an appropriate way to celebrate, I now have an image at the top of the site. Wow ‘eh? Now I am a whole 2 steps away from the default WordPress theme (the 1st step was widening the layout).</p>
<p>The past week I&rsquo;ve been busy with a variety of things. <a href="http://developer.palm.com/webChannel/index.php?packageid=com.sykhronics.smiles"><strong>Smiles for Palm Pre</strong></a> is available, and actually, I&rsquo;ve already submitted and had an update approved. So that&rsquo;s looking good.</p>
<p>My focus the last few days has been building and setting up my new desk. I&rsquo;m not quite done setting things up, so I&rsquo;ll hold off posting photos for now. My studio has/is acquiring a bunch of new furniture, so I&rsquo;d like to get everything in and set-up before the tour. 🙂</p>
<p>This year is also my big switch from <strong>Paint Shop Pro</strong> (for both raster and vector art) to <strong>Adobe CS5</strong> (Photoshop and Illustrator). CS5 Production Premium showed up earlier in the week, but I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to sit down with it until yesterday. Alongside CS5 I picked up one of the 12″ Wacom Cintiq&rsquo;s, since I imagine CS5 wont run well on my dated Tablet PC (Celeron). At GDC this year, I made a point of stopping by the Wacom booth to try out a Cintiq, to see if they had the same fuzzy-edge problem as my Tablet PC, which they do. Though after playing with the Cintiq for a couple days, the fuzzy-edges seem to distort less than the Tablet PC. Or it&rsquo;s just &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s bigger, but either way, it&rsquo;s a win.</p>
<p>Between all this fun, I&rsquo;ve been finishing my (updated) Windows and Linux ports for <a href="http://www.intelappup.com">AppUp</a>. I meant to have it done last weekend, but oh well, I guess I&rsquo;m running behind. I replaced <strong>SDL_mixer</strong> with <a href="http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/"><strong>irrKlang</strong></a> today. SDL_mixer has a bug with looping OGG files (after looping, sound distortions creep in to the stream), and <a href="http://www.galcon.com">like Phil</a>, I need something that works now. The new irrKlang sound engine is working well as a drop in replacement on Windows, but I ran in to a slight problem on Linux, though I&rsquo;m fairly sure it&rsquo;s an easy fix. I get the impression <strong>irrKlang</strong> streams everything from disk, unless explicitly played from memory. Knowing my luck there&rsquo;s a flag somewhere that says “Cache sound in RAM”, but either way, it&rsquo;s no trouble to load a file then pass it in. I&rsquo;m mentioning this since I was expecting a similar setup to SDL_mixer (and certain other sound libraries), where WAV&rsquo;s are stored in RAM, and OGG&rsquo;s stream from disk. Apparently not, heh. It&rsquo;s arguably a better design, but unexpected.</p>
<p>Also this week, <strong>Smiles HD</strong> was featured by Apple. Here&rsquo;s a pic.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2010/05/SmilesHDFeatured.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You could say I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this for a year and a half now&hellip; because&hellip; well&hellip; I have been. ;). So hooray! Smiles has <em>finally</em> been featured!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been dancing around the 70&rsquo;s on the top 100 grossing games chart most of the week. And if it could stay that high, that would be a pretty comfortable place for me earnings wise. Alas, this status of mine will be coming to an end Monday night. Still, it&rsquo;s a welcome nod from the big A.</p>
<p>Once the AppUp builds of Smiles go out, the plan is to either get back on the <em><strong>Mystery Platform</strong></em> port, or a demo/lite version of the game. I sent a pitch out last week that could introduce an immediate <strong>3rd branch</strong> to this agenda, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>As things stand, I&rsquo;m probably looking at 2-3 months more Smiles work. There&rsquo;s still some minor ports I may do, and always the possibility of one last big “hoo-rah” port, but soon I&rsquo;ll be able to focus the my time almost entirely on the new game. With Palm done, AppUp nearly finished, my whiteboard list is clearing fast.</p>
<p>July, I&rsquo;m coming for you!</p>
