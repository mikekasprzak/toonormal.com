<p>Now, this compo has been a little different. We announced our date nice and early, so the people at GDC would know about it, and to save us from silly ‚Äúwhen will the compo be?‚Äù questions. So really, it was probably our best pre-announcement for a compo date to date.</p>

<p>Then something happened.</p>
<p>Watching Twitter as I often do, I catch an offhand remark from <a href="http://www.casuallyhardcore.com/">Nelson</a>, a friend and former coworker of mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TOJam #5 (<a href="http://www.tojam.ca">http://www.tojam.ca</a>) happening April 23 to 25th at George Brown College ‚Äì not officially, but I have an inside source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that‚Äôs a familiar date.</p>
<p>At GDC 2009 I had the chance to hang out and get to know some of the ToJam guys. <a href="http://www.bigpants.ca">Jim</a>, <a href="http://www.spyeart.com">Mike</a>, etc. So GDC 2010 was rather funny to meet up with these guys again, like ‚ÄúHey, I like 2 hours away, but I only ever see you in San Fransisco‚Äù. Jim and I regular some of the same forums and sites, so we do hear from each-other in passing throughout the year.</p>
<p>And then, there was the date conflict.</p>
<p>When I first learned about, I was totally thinking to myself ‚ÄúDude! We totally have to play this up!‚Äù. Fortunately, Jim did not disappoint, and began this e-mail exchange.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2010/04/09/tojam-vs-ludum-dare/">read the rest here</a>.</p>
<p>One of the many silly things we do on the Ludum Dare site prior to the compo is motivational posters. So I‚Äôve kicked off our motivational poster game with some ToJam bashing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/</a></p>
<p>Also we had a <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=12058.0">brief back-and-forth on TIGForums</a>.</p>
<p>So yes, we are being quite childish, but it‚Äôs all in good fun. Two notable game making events running on the same weekend, it‚Äôd be a waste NOT to do something silly with that. üôÇ</p>
