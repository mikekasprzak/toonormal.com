  <div class="post-content"><p>One of the sessions I saw at GDC this year was Palm&rsquo;s talk about their new PDK (i.e. their native SDK). The promise was a Linux based mobile device featuring SDL and OpenGL ES. Since my Windows and Linux code base also uses SDL and OpenGL, that certainly caught my attention. In theory, all I need to do is just recompile my Linux version with their tools and I&rsquo;m done, right?</p>
<p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>There were 3 changes to the code I had to make. The first was a minor #DEFINE bug of mine that assumed SDL would always use OpenGL (rather than OpenGL ES). The second, I had to explicitly say what OpenGL ES version to use (“SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 1);”). The third, I had to disable writing to the Alpha channel (“glColorMask(GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_TRUE, GL_FALSE);”), as that was conflicting with a feature on WebOS that lets you composite OpenGL on top of video&hellip; pretty cool. And really, beyond configuring my makefile correctly, that was it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a bunch of platform specifics I need to walk through, but the majority of important stuff is in and working. This weekend I&rsquo;m busy (running <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a>), but I&rsquo;m hoping to package this port up and send it off next week.</p>
<p><strong>Android</strong>, well until Google <a href="http://market.android.com/publish/Home">stops hating Canada</a>, that&rsquo;s not going to happen yet. (i.e. Canadians can&rsquo;t create Google Checkout Merchant accounts). I have a G1, a Nexus One, and a Tegra board, but they&rsquo;re all just gathering dust. Previously I had the game code compiling, but I still need to set up the dummy Java app.</p>
<p><strong>Mystery platform</strong>, the game code compiles, but I still need to port my graphics library (it&rsquo;s all just stubs). Some dramatic changes are needed to finish it, so it&rsquo;s likely easier ports will come first.</p>
<p><strong>Moblin</strong>, that should be soon. I ran in to “THE” bug with SDL_Mixer on my Windows build, so I need to either fix it, report it properly (ugh), or just do an <a href="http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/">IrrKlang</a> audio port like <a href="http://www.galcon.com">Phil</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bada</strong> and <strong>Maemo</strong>, I&rsquo;m still waiting for <em>motivators</em>. 😉</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for porting.</p>
<p>I have a whole bunch of website work that I&hellip; well&hellip; just haven&rsquo;t started. Smiles HD needs a website, and for that matter, Smiles for everything needs a more general site. Sykhronics, it still says 2009 on it. I started a new design, but I left it needing some new artwork. And this blog STILL uses a default theme. So yes, while I fail at website progress, other stuff is certainly getting done.</p>
<p>I did some computer maintenance over the last week as well. Installed Windows 7 64bit in anticipation of Adobe CS5 (since nobody wants to support XP64 anymore). I&rsquo;ve actually been avoiding the “Adobe way” by using Paint Shop Pro instead of PhotoShop and Illustrator. However, Corel kinda ruined the software since it bought Jasc, and hasn&rsquo;t released a notable update for 5 years now, so I&rsquo;m finally jumping ship. Yes, ready to join the rest of the world the <em>true</em> way of PhotoShop.</p>
<p>Dabbled a bit with the new Blender 2.5, but that&rsquo;s going to require a new export plugin. I&rsquo;ll be sticking with 2.49 for the new project, or at least until 2.5 matures a bit more.</p>
<p>Doing pre-production for the new project. It&rsquo;s something better suited to <strong>mystery platform</strong> than Smiles is. I still want to be well in to production of the vertical slice before I get in to details, so sorry, that means this will continue to be a Smiles and Ludum Dare topical blog for a few more months.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all I can think of for this light ranty post.</p>
