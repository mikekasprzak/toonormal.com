  <div class="post-content"><p>I actually finished on Sunday, but the <em>final</em> mobile port of Smiles is now sent. The port is for Samsung&rsquo;s Bada mobile platform. I was pleasantly surprised how straight forward it was to get things up and running there. The system API is very much like a C++ version of Apple&rsquo;s ObjC iPhoneOS API. The whole endeavor took no more than 4 days worth of work.</p>

<p>Running in the simulator</p>
<p>So done!</p>
<p>I will continue to support the existing plethora of ports as needed, but now it&rsquo;s time to switch gears, and get going on the <strong>new project</strong>!</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve already started digging through and refactoring my code, doing all kinds of note-taking and what have you. The reason I didn&rsquo;t send the Bada port right away was because I wanted to get started. üòÄ</p>
<p>Deciding what sort of project to do next is always tricky. Like any designer worth his weight, I have several ideas in the back of my mind, each with its own rationale why I should do this as opposed to another. I tend to classify projects by their needs, unknowns, how long they should take, and how much I actually want to make them. Some ideas are potentially as short as a month, others a lot longer.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about the decision making process, but I&rsquo;ll save us both the writing and reading effort here.</p>
<p><strong>I will be making a bigger game next, not a quickie mobile game.</strong></p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t <em>got rich</em> with Smiles, but I am satisfied with its success. For a while I was concerned that I&rsquo;d need to throw together a quickie mobile game just to inch me in to a more comfortable earnings bracket. But the recent iPad featuring of Smiles HD, and a bunch of recent news about Intel&rsquo;s AppUp finally launching on devices, it was enough for me to say ‚Äúokay, I think the ports will support me just fine‚Äù. This past month was good. I doubt it&rsquo;ll be this good again next month, but a little fear is a good motivator too. üôÇ</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set myself up well. iPhone, iPad, Windows and Linux Netbook PCs, Palm Pre, Nokia N900, and Samsung Wave (Bada). And if any new opportunities come up, I&rsquo;m ready to go with any new device featuring OpenGL ES 1.1 or 2.0. Plus, the past few devices have taken me less than a week to finish each. Now that&rsquo;s more like it.</p>
<p>And while it would be great to utilize this for making a quick game and bringing it to A LOT of platforms at once, it&rsquo;ll add a whole other product for me to support, delaying my big game even more. No, lets not do that.</p>
<p>It is time to get started on <strong>it</strong>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird being ‚Äúthe Smiles guy‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Car guy‚Äù in conversations with my colleagues. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, being ‚Äúthe Car guy‚Äù is totally awesome, but that&rsquo;s a label that impresses only the first 2 times it comes up. It justifies Smiles and the porting frenzy, but by the time GDC rolls around next year, it&rsquo;ll be old news. Smiles is nearly 2 years old now. Released some 19 months ago, but I started development 4 month prior in July. There&rsquo;s not much more to prove here.</p>
<p>If we were to delve in to character flaws, one of mine might be that I&rsquo;m overly conscious of self image. I&rsquo;ve worked on a lot of games, but I&rsquo;ve yet to work on something I think really qualifies my interest in games. Why did I become a game developer? I was a fanatical game making nerd growing up, so I have this picture/feeling/mood in my mind of what a game should be (i.e. ‚Äúthe awesome‚Äù). But my entire portfolio of games from the past 10 years is all kid (girl) games and casual games. Given the conditions I am proud of what we made. But to me the game nerd, the games that I&rsquo;ve developed are what define me. They&rsquo;re not bad games to have associated with me, but if that kid who wanted to be me did the math, he would <strong><em>not</em></strong> be impressed.</p>
<p>I turn 30 in a month (July). It&rsquo;s time to start the next decade.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-working-on-now">What I&rsquo;m working on now</h2>
<p>To start, I&rsquo;ve been refactoring my code. I now have (including unreleased) 17 supported platforms in my code base, which is A LOT! So now that I have implemented this many <em>real world</em> targets, I can look at what&rsquo;s worked or what hasn&rsquo;t structurally. And it&rsquo;s not that it hasn&rsquo;t worked, but I can take this opportunity to make changes.</p>
<p>Compiling a Smiles target requires specifying several code folders (src/Game, src/OpenGL1, src/SDLMain, &hellip;), and #defining several macros that describe the platform (USES_OPENGLES, USES_UNIX, etc). This is fine, but I&rsquo;ve come to the opinion that it&rsquo;s easier to find (for example) the sound code for Platform X under Audio/PlatformX, than it is to find it under PlatformX/Audio. Every platform needs to share a common interface, otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t really be that portable.</p>
<p>So I will be (have been) moving a bunch of all-over-the-place code to where they make sense. That then means a whole bunch of specific define checks like ‚Äú#ifdef USES_UNIX_TIMER‚Äù at the top of the platform specific files. But hey, that&rsquo;s fine. Being able to actually find the code is totally worth a little scoping messyness.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-_mystery-platform_">What about <em>Mystery Platform?</em></h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming too. The Smiles for <strong><em>Mystery Platform</em></strong> port I&rsquo;ve decided to do over the summer, since I want the new game to also run on <em><strong>Mystery Platform</strong></em> (at least!). So rather than hack 1 more platform in to the code base (well actually, it&rsquo;s already there and compiling), I&rsquo;ve decided to tackle my refactoring plans now.</p>
<p>The other thing, much of the TODO list for this Smiles port meshes with my TODO list for the new game. So since I need a break from Smiles anyways, my thought is to start the new game <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong>, and by the time my needs are met by my library and tool changes, spend a week or two crunching the port together.</p>
<p>And yet another thing, Smiles makes a <strong>REALLY GOOD</strong> guinea-pig. Like really, it&rsquo;s a fully functional complete working game. What better way to test a code base than with a fully working game?</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>Tools. Lots of tools.</p>
<p>Contrary to my usual indie wisdom ‚Äúmake games without content‚Äù, I will be making a game with content. Lots of content! But the trick to content is it needs to be very fast to create, and to test. So I&rsquo;ll be spending a lot of my time over the next few months building what I need, to make the game I want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll do another rant eventually about doing a game you (I) want to create, as opposed to one the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù wants. But for now, tools.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-we-going">Where are we going?</h2>
<p>By the end of the summer I hope to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smiles for <strong><em>Mystery Platform</em></strong> finished and submitted.</li>
<li>Tools for new game up and running, in use, and already producing content.</li>
<li>To have run an awesome Ludum Dare (LD18 coming in August!) üòâ</li>
</ul>
<p>Like many people, I&rsquo;m aiming to have something ready for IGF time. I&rsquo;m confident in the concept, but there&rsquo;s a lot of work ahead of me to get there. Lots of research, lots of things to make, but man, I&rsquo;m soooo excited to be working on it! FINALLY! WOO!</p>
