<p>Getting it working on the Mac wasn’t really necessary, but I really like Xcode’s debugging tools. They made tracing the issue very straightforward. I had two VNC windows going almost constantly, as I’d make changes on the Workstation PC, commit to SVN, and sync on both the Mac and the Zotac.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good idea what was the cause of my crashes, but I still hunted for some resources.</p>
<p>MSDN 32-bit to 64bit: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3b2e7499%28VS.71%29.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3b2e7499%28VS.71%29.aspx</a></p>
<p>20 (potential) issue of 64bit porting: <a href="http://www.viva64.com/en/a/0004/">http://www.viva64.com/en/a/0004/</a></p>
<p>GCC Type Attributes: <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2.3/gcc/Type-Attributes.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2.3/gcc/Type-Attributes.html</a></p>
<p>The 3rd link isn’t really important, but to be sure I set the “packed” property on a potentially dangerous union type (pointer and int overlay, though I removed the pointer).</p>
<p>The main issue with my code was my use of <strong>size_t</strong>. I use it everywhere! That’s not a bad thing, but I also use it inside my container types. That’s also not a bad thing, but these container types are designed to be bulk-written to disk as-is, which I do in some of my file formats.</p>
<blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</blockquote>
<pre><code>size_t Size;
char Data[0];
</code></pre>
<p>};<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That was the main culprit right there. Many of my datafiles contain raw <strong>DataBlock</strong> data (streams of memory, 32bit size followed by data). As it turns out, <strong>size_t</strong> is 64bits on 64bit OS’s, causing all kinds of alignment issues. Hoo boy!</p>
<p>My response to this was to create my own <strong>size_t</strong>: <strong>st</strong> for the system version (size_t), <strong>st32</strong> for a 32bit size holding type (unsigned int), and <strong>st64</strong> for a 64bit size holding type (unsigned long long int).</p>
<blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</blockquote>
<pre><code>st32 Size; // NOT size_t due to 64bit compatibility //
char Data[0];
</code></pre>
<p>};<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Ahh, much better.</p>
<p>I’m not too concerned about the 32bit limit on the size of a <strong>DataBlock</strong>. That lets me store and allocate just under 4GB of data in one. I may <em>some day</em> add a <strong>DataBlock64</strong> type, but there’s no good reason right now (maintaining code that will never be used = waste of time).</p>
<p>As for other bugs going 64bit: On Linux, when I enabled <a href="http://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLee/">GLee</a> (the OpenGL extension library, not the musical), it introduced a number of new symbols that conflicted with my code (Thanks X Windows headers!). Bool, Status, and Font. I had to rename a bunch of variables and types to fix that.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the 64bit Linux build is consistently detecting a double-free I’m doing on exit. That one has plagued me for a while (rarely ever caused problems), so I’m glad I now have a platform that does it every time.</p>
<p>That’s all for tonight.</p>
