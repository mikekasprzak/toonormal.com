  <div class="post-content"><p>For whatever reason, I was inspired to start playing with logo designs. There’s no new decisions to be seen here in this post, just some ideas I’m playing with (and rejecting).</p>
<p>I actually used to make my own typography and font designs, one such example is this:</p>

<p>You can see more examples of <a href="/2005/11/27/classic-logos/">prior logos here</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="/2005/11/26/logo-rhythm/">the past 5 years</a> I’ve been using this:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/SykLogo_Brown.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I don’t know if I’ve ever really liked it, but it was <em>good enough</em>. The thing is, it <strong>WAS</strong> good enough, not so much anymore (or in other words, I’m bored of it).</p>
<p>Neither that or Smiles use fonts I created, with the exception of the Smiles logo and PAUSE/UNDO text.</p>

<p>So seeing how the 5 year anniversary of Sykhronics Entertainment is coming up, as well as some new projects, I think it’s time to start thinking about the branding.</p>
<p>In the “old days” (1998-2005), Sykhronics was an all-caps logo. When it became my dayjob, it went lowercase. For the new logo, I’m thinking about going back to the caps look, and maybe making my own font design again.</p>
<p>Before I go there though, I wanted to play around with some general type ideas.</p>
<p>What is <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->definitely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not obvious</strong>, Sykhronics is pronounced “Sigh Cron Icks” (Sy Khron Ics). It’s a invented word of mine that, for whatever reason, has a silent <strong>H</strong> in it. And for whatever reason, I don’t think I’ve ever done anything to emphasize (or rather, de-emphasize) the H. I could have just axed it (I do own the H-less domains), but it’s such an absurd word anyways, I left it in.</p>
<p>So the majority of my experimenting today is with the H.</p>
