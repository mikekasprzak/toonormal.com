<p>For the full transformation, hit the jump.</p>
<h2 id="day-3-8211-back-in-the-saddle">Day 3 – Back in the Saddle</h2>
<p>After a few days of other work (Smiles for Windows Phone 7), and <a href="http://www.xtranormal.com/watch/7296999/">making un-interactive interactive movies with silly internet tools</a>, I have finally resumed working on my October game.</p>
<p>For the next while I wont be using perspective, even though it looks fancier.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What you couldn’t see before was the room size was actually 32×32 (most of that was cut off). I like squares, but in practice, screens aren’t square. So the new room size is now 32×24, or in other words 4:3. That’s sounds like a weird choice given we’re all about HDTV 16:9 these days, but I actually don’t intend to show the entire room at once on screen (except when zoomed). I want some scrolling per room, but not much. I haven’t decided the optimal zoom yet, but it will depend on the target system.</p>
<p>Anyways, though I haven’t done much work yet, I need to head out to the grocery story while there’s still light. More progress to come! (Hopefully!)</p>
<h2 id="day-4-8211-a-less-lame-day-1130-am">Day 4 – A less lame day (11:30 AM)</h2>
<p>I said on my day 3 post that I “hope I come back and do more work”… which I didn’t.</p>
<p>I got up early today (9 AM… which should make you wonder when “normal” is), and did some work. I’m ignoring IRC at the moment, so I can make a whole bunch of progress.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Been tweaking the code and rough editing interface to support multiple layers and a transformation matrix. Currently it’s limited to a single room, but neighboring room editing should be soon… hopefully today.</p>
<p>Back to work.</p>
<h3 id="more-control-130-pm">More Control (1:30 PM)</h3>
<p>Now only displaying the layer info from the current layer.</p>

<p>Fun fun.</p>

<h3 id="camera-panning-715-pm">Camera Panning (7:15 PM)</h3>
<p>After a 2 hour walk, dinner, and a some bugfixing (some editor alignment bugs), we now have some very basic Camera panning.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Just about done for the night. A little more minor tweaking, then movie time.</p>
<h3 id="building-maps-in-all-directions-740-pm">Building maps in all directions (7:40 PM)</h3>
<p>I can now build maps in all directions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There seems to be a crash bug when I go to far (or at least there was earlier). I’ll tackle that tomorrow.</p>
<p>Overall, a good day.</p>
<h2 id="day-5-8211-very-short">Day 5 – Very Short</h2>
<p>Not much to show today. I’ve been drawing, but I’m not really satisfied with the results.</p>
<p>What did work out was something I wanted to try: building textures and a texture atlas in Adobe Illustrator. I’m still new to Illustrator, but I *LOVE* the “Linked Files” feature (i.e. a reference to other files).</p>
<p>So with a new “generic grass”, I did this mockup testing what auto-outline code would look like (showing in front/collision tiles).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also placed some old character art, just to see. As I can see, I’ll need to make it more “super deformed” so not to lose details.</p>
<h3 id="zoomed">Zoomed</h3>
<p>Trying out a mockup with more zoom.</p>
