  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing my daily logs over at the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare site</a>, to try and encourage more people to participate there. I&rsquo;ve really only worked on the game for 2 days, despite my plans to start early. Today I was busy with <em>something else</em>, so this week&rsquo;s update will be light.</p>
<p>This ‚Äúweek‚Äù was about getting the foundation of editor up and running. Currently it works on a 2 button mouse (right click to erase), but the editing interface will support a touch screen (tile zero is the eraser). There&rsquo;s currently no UI, but I can cycle tiles with the mouse wheel. It auto saves/loads the map to a specific file.</p>
<p>It started out looking like this:</p>

<p>Then by the end of the night Saturday, it looked like this:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested at all in the process from A to B, hit the jump for more.</p>
<p>I <em>was</em> going to do some work today (Sunday), but there&rsquo;s so little time left, I&rsquo;m calling it a night early.</p>
<h2 id="-day-1-friday-">*\<em>* Day 1 (Friday) **</em></h2>
<p>Well the plan <em>was</em> to get started before October, but due to some big stuff going on, I had to delay my start.</p>
<p>Now, late late night October 1st, I&rsquo;ve finally started.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Building an editing interface, which you can see the foundation of in the shot above. The terrain renderer has nothing to do with what I&rsquo;m doing, aside from verifying mixing my 2D and 3D code works. I don&rsquo;t have any immediate plans to use any 3D content, but it might be cool for effects. We shall see.</p>
<p>Planning to do another hour or so of work, then sleep.</p>
<h2 id="one-hour-later">One Hour Later</h2>
<p>Alright, it doesn&rsquo;t look any different, but I made my editing a little more useful. Right click acts as an ‚Äúerase‚Äù hotkey. Wow ‚Äòeh?</p>
<p>As it turns out, my cross platform framework didn&rsquo;t support multiple mouse buttons (it only supported 1 button). So I had to figure out why other buttons weren&rsquo;t working. Added multiple button support, then found it wasn&rsquo;t working (wuh!?). After some digging, it seems SDL button 1 is left click and 3 is right click (making 2 middle); I made the mistake of thinking right click would be 2. Oops!</p>
<p>So, be impressed! My crazy cross platform framework that builds for a dozen or so platforms now supports multiple mouse buttons!</p>
<p>&hellip; not impressed? Ah well.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t normally make a post in the same post, but so little has changed that I am. I&rsquo;ll be removing the terrain renderer now, so really, I just wanted to take at least 1 more pic of that. üòâ</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s probably it for tonight. Tomorrow I need to make a texture atlas of tile properties, and overlay those instead of my red boxes. Mike, you better do this within a few hours of waking up&hellip; otherwise I&rsquo;ll yell at you!</p>
<h2 id="-day-2-saturday-">*\<em>* Day 2 (Saturday) **</em></h2>
<p>I need tools to make my game, so we&rsquo;re making tools.</p>
<p>That texture atlas I quipped about yesterday now exists.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now to actually draw these icons on tiles to show their material properties.</p>
<h2 id="several-hours-later">Several Hours Later</h2>
<p>Tile properties are now displaying.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what comes next.</p>
<h2 id="hey-i-know-how-to-make-it-look-cooler">Hey&hellip; I know how to make it look cooler&hellip;</h2>
<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whoo!</p>
<h2 id="some-4-hours-later">Some 4 hours later</h2>
<p>After having cook a fancy meal (Tacos), I now have textures working!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But as you can see, I don&rsquo;t have any textures yet. Still, I can now assign them to tiles, and index in to a texture Atlas. Whee.</p>
<h2 id="even-more-hours-later-430-am">Even more hours later&hellip; 4:30 AM</h2>
<p>Yes many hours have passed, but a major incremental milestone has been hit: Saving and Loading maps.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Between all kinds of ‚ÄúI&rsquo;m tired‚Äù slacking, I finally got this done. It&rsquo;s using my chunked file format used by my Smiles UI code. Hooray for re-use!</p>
<p>This is definitely it for the night. I have no idea where I&rsquo;ll pick up tomorrow&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even want to think about it. Brain is mush, proceed to bed. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.</p></div>
