  <div class="post-content"><p>Alright! The iPad is coming soon, as is a brand new version of <a href="http://www.smiles-game.com"><strong>Smiles</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As we speak I&rsquo;m putting the finishing touches on <a href="http://www.smiles-game.com"><strong>Smiles HD</strong></a>, the all new higher resolution and slightly redesigned iPhone game coming soon to the iPad.</p>
<p>Now, in the eyes of Apple I&rsquo;m nobody special. So like many of you, I&rsquo;ll be heading down to my local Apple store on launch day to pick me up an iPad&hellip; with one <em>slight</em> difference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Canada.</p>
<p>Why that matters is that only the US is getting them on April 3rd. So in order for <a href="http://www.smiles-game.com"><strong>Smiles HD</strong></a> to be in the App Store for (nearly) iPad launch, we&rsquo;re going on a road trip!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2010/03/CanadaUSA.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Agenda for April 3rd, 2010: 1. Go to the US; 2. Pick up an iPad; 3. Denny&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Using Google&rsquo;s excellent cartography skills, it looks like my trip to the nearest Apple store in the US will take roughly 2 hours. Not bad, but by ‚Äúroad trip‚Äù standards that&rsquo;s rather light weight. And thanks to Apple&rsquo;s reservation feature, this trip <strong>wont</strong> even require camping!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2010/03/WiiCamping.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Not my photo, but some friends and I did camp out several hours for the Wii. Again, we&rsquo;re in Canada. It was cold.</p>
<p>So as far as road trips go, this one wont impress any <em>real</em> outdoors-men. But hey, I&rsquo;m totally going out of my way for it. As I see it, <strong>I need one</strong>. Not as an Apple fan boy (though I do love gadgets), but for business.</p>
<h2 id="on-making-a-living">On making a living</h2>
<p>Admittedly, my luck lately has been <strong>really awesome</strong>, but <a href="/2010/03/18/mike-the-multi-winner-and-gdc-champion/">free trips</a> and <a href="/2010/02/03/the-intel-is-awesome-post/">cars</a> don&rsquo;t pay the bills. Heh, ‚ÄúOh no! Poor you! If you need money, go sell your free car!‚Äù! Heh, I&rsquo;d rather not, but I&rsquo;m also not exactly in financial danger right now. The car is an asset available to me if something does happen. But right now, I&rsquo;m very optimistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent game developer, and I work full time on my own games. Being able to say that is really awesome, and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m extremely proud of. Self employed, my own boss, earning an income by my rules. You could say I&rsquo;m ‚Äúliving the dream‚Äù. It certainly is mine.</p>
<p>If you follow any other game developers, you&rsquo;ll note that the majority of them tend to fall in to one of two groups. Creating a big game in a year+, or creating multiple small games in a year. Prior to <strong>Smiles</strong>, I definitely fell in to the 1st group (<a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/PoVRAZOR/videos/11/">2 year project that&rsquo;s currently shelved</a>). But I don&rsquo;t exactly fit in to either definition right now. <strong>Smiles</strong> was a 4 month game, and a year and a half later my news is still <strong>Smiles HD</strong> this and <strong>Smiles</strong> that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the deal?</p>
<p><strong>Smiles</strong> is a bizarre success story. As far as describing its success level, I&rsquo;d call it the perfect middle. Financially it&rsquo;s done well enough that yes, it&rsquo;s clear that I can make a living from my own games. My costs are low, and I don&rsquo;t have a team or family to support, so I can justify any deficiency in profit as being ‚Äúthe first game‚Äù. It also has critical acclaim. 5&rsquo;s, 4&rsquo;s, 4.5&rsquo;s, high regard on every notable game site that&rsquo;s reviewed it. It was a finalist in the IGF Mobile for ‚ÄúBest Mobile Game‚Äù in 2009. And this year it <em>rocked</em> Intel&rsquo;s Atom Developer Challenge scoring 2nd in the early bird contest, and the ‚ÄúElegance in Design‚Äù award. It even <a href="/2009/12/23/i-was-4th-place/">nabbed a Bronze</a> in Samsung&rsquo;s contest too. From all that, yes, I&rsquo;d say <strong>Smiles</strong> is a success.</p>
<p>Am I a success? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is my business a success though? Mmmmm&hellip; I&rsquo;d probably shrug and say ‚Äúmeh‚Äù to that.</p>
<p>If you look to the first 3 year since leaving the day job, I earned nothing. Drained the savings a bunch, even threw down a decent chunk of change on outsourcing art. That&rsquo;s fine though. As far as I was concerned, the money was meant for that. But though my costs are low, that money is still gone.</p>
<p><strong>Smiles</strong> is an upward trend. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it&rsquo;s on the cusp of success in a big way. I really think it just needs to get in front of its audience, and the rest will all fall in to place. Perhaps if I was a month earlier on iPhone, it would have already. But hey, that wouldn&rsquo;t have been as interesting of a story. üôÇ</p>
<p><strong>I am betting on iPad</strong>.</p>
<p>I have zero assurance that Apple will do anything for me, but I am ready to make launch. They could very well just ignore me again, but I&rsquo;ll be there from the beginning this time. I&rsquo;m hopeful, but we&rsquo;ll see how this goes.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m betting on a lot of things. Netbooks, I think there&rsquo;s big potential there in the long term. Other mobile devices, absolutely. A certain portable gaming console I&rsquo;ve been vaguely hinting at, definitely! As I see it, <strong>Smiles</strong> will either become a bigger success as a macro product (the sum of all it&rsquo;s ports), or it will breakout somewhere (which hopefully ripples throughout the entire platform portfolio). As I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;m very optimistic, and I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>I hope the Apple community isn&rsquo;t offended by my dramatic lack of exclusivity. I do hope it acts to reinforce me and my companies significance, but really, I gotta eat.</p>
<p>I think my direction makes an interesting story. When I get to the end of this platforms blitz, I&rsquo;ll have a plethora of new targets for my follow up projects (one game I&rsquo;m expecting to start in the next few months). I sure hope this works out. I&rsquo;d love to be able to give a talk at GDC some year and be able to say ‚Äúyes, it worked‚Äù. My story is starting to get really good right now, here&rsquo;s hoping for a happy ending.</p>
<h2 id="coming-up-next-for-smiles-hd">Coming up next for Smiles HD</h2>
<p>Alright, now that I have that rant out of my system, lets talk details. I have a short term plan for the next few weeks I&rsquo;m hoping to stick to. It looks something like this.</p>
<p><strong>#1. Next Week</strong>: Release a preview/development log video.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;m finishing up the game now. I&rsquo;m hoping to be done my TODO list well before the 3rd, and when I am, I think it&rsquo;ll be a nice to do a behind the scenes demonstration of the game. A fun look at some of my iPad-less compromises. Essentially, to make my own small contribution to the iPad hype.</p>
<p><strong>#2. Before the 3rd</strong>: Make press pack.</p>
<p>Pretty straight forward. I can take and make screenshots now, as well as draft up my sales pitch for the store, write a press release, etc. I suppose I can even release this early&hellip; I might just do that.</p>
<p><strong>#3. April 3rd</strong>: Pick up iPad.</p>
<p>See above.</p>
<p><strong>#4. ASAP</strong>: Submit to Apple.</p>
<p>I imagine Apple will officially allow submissions day 1, so sure, an option would be to just send it once we get the public SDK. Though I&rsquo;ve played the game a lot, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel right sending it without a good day of serious device testing. I&rsquo;m not anticipating any real problems, though there&rsquo;s always the possibility of being late overall, but even that currently seems unlikely. Best case, sent on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>#5. After that</strong>: Make (quick) Trailer</p>
<p>Smiles was originally approved REALLY FAST, in about 2 days. Even more crazy, Smiles Zen took half a day to approve. So what I&rsquo;ve learned from that is I need to be ready just in case. If I have some spare days, I may do some preparations. Use a proxy device to figure out where/how to hold it, briefly storyboard the trailer, or so on. Just so I&rsquo;m able to <em>have something</em> for the press once it&rsquo;s ready. I feel bad that I&rsquo;m not going to have time to give the press an early look at things, but nobody has iPad&rsquo;s yet. We&rsquo;ll all be playing this product launch by ear.</p>
<p><strong>#6. After that</strong>: Websites</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real shame, but I probably wont have a chance to redesign the <strong>Sykhronics</strong> and <strong>Smiles</strong> websites before launch. I&rsquo;m hoping I do, but knowing me, that&rsquo;ll come later. The <a href="http://www.smiles-game.com">smiles-game.com</a> website is in dire need of updates, since it&rsquo;s available for more than just the iPhone, and coming soon to several more devices. Same with the <a href="http://www.sykhronics.com">Sykhronics</a> website, it&rsquo;s still tagged as 2009, and makes no reference to my IGF and Intel success. I&rsquo;m not even sure I&rsquo;d have time to delegate the work either (assuming I had someone to delegate it to). It&rsquo;ll just happen when it happens.</p>
<p>Besides finishing the game itself, I want to be doing everything I can for the press right now. My inbox and blog comments are open. If you have a question, feel free to contact me one of those ways. If I don&rsquo;t respond to you directly, I&rsquo;ll try to make some FAQ like posts on my blog here.</p>

<p>And speaking of serving the press, here&rsquo;s a new screenshot for you. Click for highres PNG.</p>
