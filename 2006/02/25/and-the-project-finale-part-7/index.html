<p>Okay, I wanted an epic name to finish my cheesy little series of updates. Then it&rsquo;s <strong>actual updates when they happen!!</strong>! Wow! That actually makes this a blog, instead of story time!</p>
<h6 id="but-i-like-story-time-">But I like story time &hellip;</h6>
<p>So back to the technical. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll put a stupid image at the end to better transition artfulness to technicallityfullness.</p>
<p>Way back, I mentioned the engine used the monkey of a library AllegroGL, as a wrapper to hardware, and OpenGL. Well, some time in December, we decided we couldn&rsquo;t stand the instability of AllegroGL. Yes, AllegroGL, the not so updated piece of honk honk is unstable. I&rsquo;m actually impressed the game worked at all. I had to disable deletion and destruction of any GL or related objects so the game wouldn&rsquo;t crash on exit, and trust XP to handle all the recovery of memory. It was that bad.</p>
<p>So eventually, on and off busy with <em>some other obligation</em>, the code was ported and made a tad more generic as we moved to SDL/OpenGL. Hurah. And an exciting story that was.</p>
<p>And wow, that&rsquo;s it? We&rsquo;re all caught up!!</p>
<p>Okay, well, I guess we&rsquo;ve been building some tools as well. These past few weeks, Richard has been working on the object editor. Collision/Spring placement is all there now, and he&rsquo;s started working on our little interface for associating display polygons with these fancy collision thingies we can make.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/editor01.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Sophisticated looking isn&rsquo;t it? So, soon we&rsquo;ll be playing with and building game content.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s me. As mentioned last time, I&rsquo;m working on art stuffs at the moment. I gave myself a crash course in <a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a>, and I seem to have that reasonably well figured out. Though, I wish the scaling via the normals feature was a tad less destructive. Anyways, prior to that, I&rsquo;ve been toying with game mechanics, and fixing stuff to make the editing interface work. One item from the mechanic playing was switching to a segmented rope, instead of just the big spring between point A and point B.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/engine08.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Visually it&rsquo;s nice, as it&rsquo;s all bendy, curvy and swingy. But what you can&rsquo;t see in this image, is that compared to the old rope, this one&rsquo;s functionality is crap. So, it appears <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umihara_Kawase">Umihara Kawase</a> got it right, with the stiff rope that bends only when it crosses collision. Unfortunately that means a bunch more work, making the rope a really special case in the engine&rsquo;s design.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this *other* gameplay element I&rsquo;ve been toying with, with some encouraging success. But I&rsquo;m going to be an ass, and sit on it for now. I&rsquo;ll try not to tease it like it&rsquo;s some super clever gameplay element or something. It&rsquo;s more of an “oh! hey cool!” type mechanic, than a “Holy shoe!” type mechanic. That&rsquo;s right, shoe.</p>
<p>And there it is. You&rsquo;re caught up. I&rsquo;m experimenting with art stuffs now, so expect something on that front to pop up. I can&rsquo;t vouch for exact days or frequency of updates. Every couple weeks though, there should be something. Or just RSS me, and know. RSS, it&rsquo;s an ESP for us non psychics.</p>
<p>And, your wacky image.</p>

<p>Have a good week.</p>
