<p>So, right now, the current evolution of the character is this said goo blob thing. It shoots these tentacles/appendages out and swings, like any good monkey should.</p>
<p>However, for as long as I&rsquo;ve been thinking about going with a gooey character, I&rsquo;d been concerned about the <a href="http://www.gishgame.com">Gishness</a> factor. This “factor” is what I&rsquo;m calling all the references to Gish. Comments like “reminds me of Gish”, “very Gish like”, or “gross, there&rsquo;s Gish in my coffee”. To test this theory (and to indulge in positive commentary), I shared a gameplay video with several friends. But despite its complete lack of hard/soft/sticky gameplay, the Gishness comments were there. Damn. How appropriate though, given I poked fun at another <a href="/archives/52">Gishlike experience</a>, back in the early days of this blog. Good job Mike. The gold star of suck is yours. Still, I&rsquo;d be getting those references even if I went with a spider character.</p>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/goo05.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>But there is a reason I&rsquo;m sticking with the dynamic gooey character idea. The best part about random goo entities, is they <strong>totally</strong> make sense to have unexplained things growing out of it, not just tentacles.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/goo06.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, “totally” is pushing it, but it&rsquo;s ether goo or a magical tire&hellip; or perhaps a magical orange. But they don&rsquo;t make as much sense, that is, without the over use of “magic” as the explanation. Magic limbs, magic trees, magic game crashes. No bugs here, just magic features.</p>
<p>But hey, it&rsquo;s still early development, and nothing is really finalized. I&rsquo;m currently working on establishing the art style, so more artful thing should pop up in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Or maybe. Just maybe, I&rsquo;ll find what the game really needs is a potato character that lacks self confidence.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the finale, as I get us technically up to date in: Part 7, <em>a Sunset in Stone</em>.</p>
