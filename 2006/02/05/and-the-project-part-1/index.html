<p>As mentioned previously, things started out as my long overdue PuffBOMB remake. So, a physics engine was built, based on what I&rsquo;d learned from various tech demo&rsquo;s (which I&rsquo;ll post at a later date). And it did cool stuff.</p>

<p>Good ‘ol <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030121/jacobson_pfv.htm">verlet physics</a> action. What you can see above is “characters” composed of spheres (circles), connected by springs. Cool stuff. The 3 circle thang is a potential collision model for the PuffBOMB hamster, and the Balloon like thing is exactly that. So, there&rsquo;s a bunch of fun static collision for them to whack in to, as well as each other.</p>
<p>And not to be out done, some moving stackable polygons as well.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/engine02.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Their collision is still a tad buggy at the moment, and I neglected to take a better shot than this, but I&rsquo;ll be back on that soon.</p>
<p>At this point, I got thinking how I should be able to make a fine enough game with the sphere cluster objects above and static collision, so I continued on.</p>
<p>With the 360 launch on the horizon, I&rsquo;d been feeling the inspiration to pull together something for <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/livearcadexbox360/">Xbox Live Arcade</a>. The only problem, is PuffBOMB as a game in my opinion doesn&rsquo;t really suit a gamepad. After a bunch of reflection and all that, I made the tough decision to put the remake *back* on hold, and to dig in to my bin of game concepts I&rsquo;d like to make. This time, one that&rsquo;d take advantage of a gamepad.</p>
<p>So what happened? This post has grown quite image intensive, so I&rsquo;m cutting it off right here. Let the tags be your tease. Stay tuned for part 2.</p>
