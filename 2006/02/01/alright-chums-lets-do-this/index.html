<p>February the 1st. I&rsquo;m mere minutes away from missing this chance to post and make the first of this month, yet I prevail. Ha ha!</p>
<p>Hopefully, I&rsquo;m finally getting my act together. We&rsquo;re already a month in to 2006, and really I haven&rsquo;t had much to show. It seems I&rsquo;ve been in a less than ideal situation up until recently. It&rsquo;s resolution was equally as not so idealistic, so excuse me as I be vague, until the day we all look back and laugh about it. Har har. And as much as I *love* big vaporware plans, I plan not to be one. So here we are, starting the month out right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the middle of writing up a little introduction as to what is going on around here in Sykoland. So yes, in fact, I&rsquo;m just delaying you with insightful commentary as I type amazing things, and better grasp what&rsquo;s really going on. Boy do I have some fly tales of developin&rsquo; to be&rsquo;all tellin&rsquo; youz &lsquo;bout soon. Yee!</p>
<p>Last waste post, I promise. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=""></p>
