<p>Hopefully, I’m finally getting my act together. We’re already a month in to 2006, and really I haven’t had much to show. It seems I’ve been in a less than ideal situation up until recently. It’s resolution was equally as not so idealistic, so excuse me as I be vague, until the day we all look back and laugh about it. Har har. And as much as I *love* big vaporware plans, I plan not to be one. So here we are, starting the month out right.</p>
<p>I’m in the middle of writing up a little introduction as to what is going on around here in Sykoland. So yes, in fact, I’m just delaying you with insightful commentary as I type amazing things, and better grasp what’s really going on. Boy do I have some fly tales of developin’ to be’all tellin’ youz ’bout soon. Yee!</p>
<p>Last waste post, I promise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
