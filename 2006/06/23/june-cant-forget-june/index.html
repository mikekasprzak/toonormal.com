<p>The project progresses. We’re busy preparing a pitch-able playable of the game that we’ll be pitchely pitching to potential pitch-able people pretty pitching soon. I’ll have less riddles and more to say about that in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve silently (and finally) put together a <a href="http://www.puffbomb.com">MacOS X version of PuffBOMB</a>. Sadly, it’s only for Power PC based Mac’s running Panther (10.3) or better. I don’t have an Intel Mac, so I don’t know if it runs under Rosetta. I’ve also done some minor bug fixing with the Windows version (Dual Core friendly now), and made a slight improvement to the background (subtle teaser to your right, can you tell the difference?). This was inspired by and for something I’ll talk about soon (NDA).</p>
<p>As for other fun things, I’ve been toying with videos! I recorded gameplay demonstration movies of the infamous PuffBOMB, and one of a other lesser known prototype game of mine, Zooble.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sykhronics.com/zooble/">Zooble</a> – 2004 Game Prototype</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Classic PuffBOMB – 2003 Game Prototype (revised in 2005)</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ll probably encode more historic game videos later. I do have a couple prototype progress videos of the current stuff, but I’m sitting on those until we sign something.</p>
<p>And now I’m off to see if I can safely upgrade and “fix” my spam problem here. I temporarily disable commenting,that way I wouldn’t have wake up every morning and delete Viagra, Home Insurance/Mortgages, Casinos, Poker, and whatever other crap I’ve been manually filtering. Manual sucks.</p>
