  <div class="post-content"><p><strong>April 1st, 2006</strong> – Dr.Soft Inc, a leading developer of medical imaging solutions has partnered with Sykhronics Entertainment to bring you <em><strong>Anatomatch: Inside the Human Body</strong></em>. Anatomatch brings the wonderful world of anatomy and addictive matching game-play together in a synergy of edutainment awesomeness. Anatomatch represents an innovative gaming experience targeting medical professionals, and students.</p>
<p>Featuring the patent pending “<em>Full Body Match</em>“, where 5 organs are matched by their connectivity in the body. For extensive educational value, the game features insightful medical trivia between levels. As well, the game includes our double patented trademark advanced _Higher Score_™ system, suitable to the needs of educational institutes and drunken late night skirmishes with your friends.</p>
<p>Anatomatch is under review by the National Medical Institute as “<em>fast track</em>” alternative to a 4 year college undergraduate degree in medicine.</p>
<p>“We’re pleased to be working with Dr.Soft towards enhancing medical education.” says Dr.Daniel Watson, NMI, “I’ve been in medicine for 16 years, and I earned an impressive high score of 2,123,200 points! We’re considering the half million point mark being the target of an education, and replacing the legacy ‘<em>years experience</em>‘ system with a sophisticated measurement of every 100,000 point above half million. I believe this system is without flaw, and don’t see how anyone without 5 years of medical experience could break the 1 million mark.”</p>
