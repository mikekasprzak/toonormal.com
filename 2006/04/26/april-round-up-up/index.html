  <div class="post-content"><p>Yup, I’m a few days behind mentioning this, but this month’s <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=467">round up</a> is up.

<p>As expected, I’m going to say things are going well with the game, despite the updates. Actually, better than well. Much Biz oriented stuff, which I’m going to have to sit on for a while. Very exciting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And something that made my day today, the <a href="http://pspupdates.qj.net/LocoRoco-demo-downloadable-now/pg/49/aid/28713">Loco Roco demo</a>. Playing it is certainly a treat. The controls are a little tricky, since these things have a mind of their own. Some high speed glitches I’ve been fighting with physics wise, I’m surprised to see, actually show up in this game. I’m starting to suspect I’m just too anal for my own good. I think the art style is awesome, but I’m weird like that. Oh, and did I mention, <em>they</em> sing?</p>
