<p>So, that&rsquo;s what happens on the 91&rsquo;st day of the year shows up, your name is Mike, and you want to poke fun at casual gaming. You end up with a human body themed <em>match 3</em>, and an outrageous story that I don&rsquo;t even want to rationalize. And yes, all Mike&rsquo;s were thinking the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, this post is a rather plain one. Just a confirmation that yes, that was a joke, and an excuse to do an image dump. I especially like how the <em>action pose</em> heart turned out. So much, I&rsquo;ve been thrusting my arms in to the air all day. The funny looks from people are obviously looks of jealousy.</p>
<p>And here comes the team.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/bodyteam.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>And together they form.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/piecard.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find a <em>Captain Planet</em> picture I liked, and besides, <em>Jean Luc Picard</em> is a way better Captain, and he totally destroys Captain Planet.</p>
<p>Over the course of the day, these “body parts” have also turned in to test objects for the game, as we&rsquo;re short on interesting things&hellip; at least one&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re not embarrassed to show.</p>
<p>Oh, and I did receive a request for the art assets, which I shared, so there might actually be a playable game on the way. Pretty crazy for an April fools joke.  <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>
