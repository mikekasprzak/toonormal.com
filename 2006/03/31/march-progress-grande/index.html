<p>The Object and Map Editors are functional and working great. We’ve been refining them this past week, as we’ve built experimental content. I imagine some time next week we’ll start toying with an actual game scene/level.</p>
<p>Object editor, with all it’s collision placement, polygon building, and linking goodness.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Map editor, with all it’s placement goodness.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>And of course, all this fun stuff works in game too. Something that’s not as obvious about the tools is we can build stalky objects like blades of grass, trees, or sign posts, which can bend nicely around objects as you crash in to them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We’re still a ways off, but it’s finally starting to shape up. With luck, by the end of April it’ll look like a game.</p>
<p>Have a safe April fools.</p>
