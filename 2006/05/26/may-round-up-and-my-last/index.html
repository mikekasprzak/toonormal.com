  <div class="post-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=477">round up for may</a> is up. Heh, I’m sure I’m going to be scolded by <a href="http://www.hamumu.com">Mike</a> and <a href="http://www.rtsoft.com">Seth</a> for not finding time to mention to them that this would be my last round up, but in a way, that’s half the reason why. Busy busy.</p>
<p>A hand full of interesting games this month. Eets, the TIM like game with the hungry mood swing guy; Bone: The Great Cow Race, a fine modern example of comic gone adventure game; Odyssey: Winds of Athena, the game with the water currents gameplay; and American History Lux, desensitizing gamers of war since 1754.</p>
<p>So there we have it. This month puts me just over a year and a half’s worth of round up’s. It’s been a great little research project. I’ve played a lot of interesting games I would have normally missed. It’s been a really great way to put the Indie and Casual games industry in to perspective.</p>
<p>And now, back to the grind. Just like last month/post suggested, things are busy. There was a bit of a significant project direction shift then, to better meet a quickly approaching deadline. I’m afraid this annoying “vague” tone is required for a month or two more. That, and I’d rather speak with images.</p>
