  <div class="post-content"><p>You see, what&rsquo;s fun about big computers is&hellip; oh wait&hellip; there&rsquo;s no fun here.</p>
<p>Back sometime in ‘98, whilst I was working in a computer store, my fascination with big computer crap began. And I purchased this massive “Server” case, which was PC&rsquo;s case for a couple years. Eventually, this behemoth of a case was “promoted” to an actual server, since routine maintenance/upgrades were painful given it&rsquo;s shear mass.</p>
<p>Then in ‘04, I had the brilliant idea to purchase the biggest, fattest Laptop mankind has ever seen. The original Dell XPS.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/xps.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>9 pounds of desktop replacement power. Actually, let me rephrase that. <em>Notebook</em>, not Laptop. When placed on ones lap, it doubles as a device that makes you forget you have legs.</p>
<p>So it took me far too long to come to the conclusion that big &amp; heavy computers != good. Great. Why are we here?</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/oldserver.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, <em>The Behemoth *cough*</em> case, and server for that matter, is on it&rsquo;s way in to retirement. This <em>was</em> something our little 2 man operation planned to deal with <em>after</em> the game was out. Alas, a number of factors have encouraged us to act sooner.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1.</strong> We killed the Cisco!</li>
<li><strong>2.</strong> Reading/Writing from the old server was slower than something really slow</li>
<li><strong>3.</strong> Hearing the sound of “water dripping” coming from a computer is&hellip; discerning</li>
<li><strong>4.</strong> Building a new computer <em>might</em> be fun (the <em>new</em> part, more than the <em>building</em> part)</li>
</ul>
<p>We kill routers. Doesn&rsquo;t matter who makes them, we&rsquo;ve killed one or two from that manufacturer. I&rsquo;m sure glad Future Shop/Best Buy offers extended warranties. Thus, in response to our discovery of there being no such thing as a reliable consumer router, we did what any pack of blood sucking marsupials would do. We ordered a used Cisco router on eBay. $200, and some mis-shipped power supplies later, we were in Cisco town.</p>
<p>However, it recently decided that forwarding HTTP requests was stupid or <em>above it</em>, and quit. Thanks <em>Crisco</em>. I hope you enjoy life on the cold dank shelf of unused computer crap.</p>
<p>I suspect we could have fixed it just fine, but that was hardly the first problem we&rsquo;ve had with it. One XBox Live connection at a time only? No thanks. Pain to configure for someone with Cisco certification? <em>Double</em> no thanks.</p>
<p>So in an effort to kill 37 birds with one really freaking sharp stone, we&rsquo;ve researched, devised, and developed brand new server. The <em>lowest end</em> Intel Core 2 Duo money can buy, a Gig of RAM, 4 320GB drives in a RAID 5 array, 3 NIC&rsquo;s (1+2), and a small case actually large enough to hold all that.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s blue.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/wp/blueserver.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>She&rsquo;s all built, the bulk of the data&rsquo;s been migrated over (SVN repository, data, reference material), and she&rsquo;s humming nicely in the corner running Fedora Core 6, 64bit style. There&rsquo;s no point going in to detail about our Linux complications, but it&rsquo;s *cough* a good sign when the first version you get to work right was released 3 days ago.</p>
