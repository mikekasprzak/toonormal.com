Too Normal is my blog. Me, Mike, this questionably sane guy who makes games. Video games. That crazy amalgamation of visual and sonic goodness and a mighty tech chew. Too Normal is here to share my experience, observations and insight into what I do moving forward.
Who are you?
A “crazy” programmer with well over 5 years of commercial game programming experience, a dozen credits to my name, a history of programming and game development that goes back to when I measured my age with fingers, enough art skill that I get requests, a pair of credits doing voice acting (though I’m an awful actor), and several youthful years tracking music (this needs the most work).">

<p><strong>Why are we here?</strong></p>
<p>Too Normal is my blog. Me, Mike, this questionably sane guy who makes games. Video games. That crazy amalgamation of visual and sonic goodness and a mighty tech chew. Too Normal is here to share my experience, observations and insight into what I do moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
<p>A “crazy” programmer with well over 5 years of commercial game programming experience, a dozen credits to my name, a history of programming and game development that goes back to when I measured my age with fingers, enough art skill that I get requests, a pair of credits doing voice acting (though I’m an awful actor), and several youthful years tracking music (this needs the most work). I also write for GameTunnel.</p>
<p><strong>When do we start?</strong></p>
<p>After all the years of crunching and giving up my time to game studios, I’m taking a break. In the next several weeks when my current project wraps up, I’m taking leave. That’s when the fun begins.</p>
<p>That’s it for now. This has been your introduction.</p>
