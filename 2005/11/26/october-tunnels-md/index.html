  <div class="post-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com/html/section-viewarticle-138.html">round up for October</a> is up, sporting the <em>sexah</em> new look for the <a href="http://www.gametunnel.com">Game Tunnel</a> website. This month sees Russell joining the ranks of the illustrious panel, bringing us to 4. It also shows us taking a more reserved 10 game count, which I think we’ll be sticking with moving forward.</p>
<p>So, how was the month? Two games I really liked this month, Weird Worlds and Cute Knight. Just as I said in my review, and as the others agreed, Weird Worlds is great. I’m not big on many games built around randomly generated maps, but it works excellent here. Then there’s Cute Knight. A kwirky little RPG’ish game I got a kick out of. There was also the unique strategy game Kosumi. I really tried to enjoy this game, but it would have been too much of a commitment. Still, I think it was a good month.</p>
