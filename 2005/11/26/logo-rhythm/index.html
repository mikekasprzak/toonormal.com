Ahh yes, a smooth graphic design’ish logo. Hurah.
Do I like it? I’m not sure. I’m torn between going with something more cartoony, or including a little face in the logo.">

<p>Way back in July I dropped a note about some <a href="/archives/27">Rejected Logos</a>. I still haven’t decided what I want, but I’ve been back playing the logo making game.</p>

<p>Ahh yes, a smooth graphic design’ish logo. Hurah.</p>
<p>Do I like it? I’m not sure. I’m torn between going with something more cartoony, or including a little face in the logo. It’s to represent a shift in Sykhronics’s direction. It’s certainly different. Perhaps it’s approprite weather I’m gaga over it or not.</p>
<p>Since 1998, Sykhronics was the branding I used for my independent works, and my personal website. Actually, it was the branding I had planned to use on everything, but I found I stuck my name on them instead, and Sykhronics ended up just being the website. Moving forward, since I’m turning this in to a business, it’s got to have a name. Mike Kasprzak Software sounds *really* lame, I have to say. My apologies to any developers with YOUR-NAME-HERE company names, but ‘cmon. I’d be happier if you called yourself Klingon Software, or Jedi Interactive. If all you’ve got to express yourself is nerddom, then so be it.</p>
<p>An earlier rendition of the logo is this, back when Sykhronix was going to be the business, and Sykhronics would stay as my personal site.</p>
<p><img src="/content/sykologoold.gif" alt="Old, like &hellip; grandma"></p>
<p>I have dozens of old Sykhronics logo’s which I’d like to dig up for my own reference, so I may post that soon. Half of the charm of developing Sykhronics has been my option to change the logo whenever I wanted. I’m leaning towards the new one above only to help solidify the more businessy approach I’m taking the branding, that is until I come up with something better.</p>
