Right. Things are back and working in the Mike camp. Back to the grind and all. I’ve also recently finished a drawing pad, after slightly over 3 months. Doesn’t sound like much, but looking back it’s been taking me up to a year to fill one up.
So IGF finalists have been announced. Funky. So many great games have been coming out later in the year, I’m not surprised PuffBOMB didn’t place.">

<p>Right. Things are back and working in the Mike camp. Back to the grind and all. I’ve also recently finished a drawing pad, after slightly over 3 months. Doesn’t sound like much, but looking back it’s been taking me up to a year to fill one up.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.igf.com">IGF</a> finalists have been announced. Funky. So many great games have been coming out later in the year, I’m not surprised <a href="http://www.puffbomb.com">PuffBOMB</a> didn’t place. Maybe way back in 2003 when I made the game, and when the IGF wasn’t as cool of an event to be part of. Hey, I entered. It’s a start. Maybe next time.</p>
<p>All is not lost. Actually, it’s quite the opposite. I’ve received a rather encouraging note from the <a href="http://www.slamdance.com/games/">SlamDance</a> camp. I imagine they’ll be posting a finalists list soon. Assuming I can trust my inbox, you should find PuffBOMB there on said finalist list. Not to mention, on display at the January SlamDance event. Very cool.</p>
<p>Oh, and before I forget, more cover-disks for the PuffBOMB freeware game. This months PC Zone (UK Mag) and Level (Czech Mag) cover-disks should feature the game. Very cool 2.</p>
<p>That should do for today. Lets see how much longer I can neglect to talk about what I’m working on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
