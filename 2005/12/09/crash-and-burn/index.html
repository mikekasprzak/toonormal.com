  <div class="post-content"><p>Crud. This’d normally be a good place to stick an image, but that’s the problem.</p>
<p>Tuesday evening, I’m minding my own business playing a game on my laptop, when suspiciously my desktop PC reboots. I thought nothing of it, and continued playing. Several hours later, I’m shutting everything down for the night, and I find the desktop locking up in the Bios detecting the IDE devices. Whatever, we’ll look in to it in the morning.</p>
<p>Next day, fire it up, same deal. So, long story short, the hard drive is dead. Yeah, it sucks. On the plus side, game code is sitting in a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> repository on the server, which itself is on a mirrored raid array. And my art stuffs I conveniently backed up on Monday. Down side, audio stuff I didn’t even consider backing up is toast, and so are any small things from the morning I hadn’t committed to the repository yet. Oh, that and I have to reinstall everything.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Like having your project canceled, the hard drive crash is a depressing time. So, I took the rest of Wednesday and Thursday off for some sympathy gaming.</p>
<p>So, this sounds as good a place as any to pick up on that lackluster blogging of mine.</p>
<p><a href="http://ludumdare.com">LudumDare</a> is today, and I have a Christmas party with some friends to attend. Oh, and I have getting that desktop PC of mine going ahead of me. Sounds like a busy weekend.</p>
