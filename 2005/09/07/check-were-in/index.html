<p>Hmm, it seems I misplaced this blog post.</p>
<p>With less than 5 hours to spare, it&rsquo;s in. Excellent. It wasn&rsquo;t without it&rsquo;s drama though. Once confirmed by myself, my brother, and a few friends that everything was good, I began to upload. *OH GOOD*, the upload server was acting up! Ack!</p>
<p>Within 20 minutes things cleared up. I snuck my game into it&rsquo;s folder, hit the switch, and waited as it&rsquo;s bytes were sucked out of Canada into some server likely in the California area. Fun.</p>
<p>So there it is. I&rsquo;ll be sitting on this revamped version of the game for a few weeks, as I get some promotional material together (i.e. screen shots) of the new game. Then, when I can clearly distinguish that it&rsquo;s a different product we&rsquo;re pushing (not the old PB), it&rsquo;ll go out as a freebie. And hey, the Mac guys will finally be able to play. A shame though, that they can&rsquo;t use the old map editor.</p>
<p>Time to celebrate with,&hellip; Sleep! Something I&rsquo;m far to familiar with as of late. Ahh, time off is great. <img src="/assets/wp/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>
