  <div class="post-content"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hmm, it seems I misplaced this blog post.</p>
<p>With less than 5 hours to spare, it’s in. Excellent. It wasn’t without it’s drama though. Once confirmed by myself, my brother, and a few friends that everything was good, I began to upload. *OH GOOD*, the upload server was acting up! Ack!</p>
<p>Within 20 minutes things cleared up. I snuck my game into it’s folder, hit the switch, and waited as it’s bytes were sucked out of Canada into some server likely in the California area. Fun.</p>
<p>So there it is. I’ll be sitting on this revamped version of the game for a few weeks, as I get some promotional material together (i.e. screen shots) of the new game. Then, when I can clearly distinguish that it’s a different product we’re pushing (not the old PB), it’ll go out as a freebie. And hey, the Mac guys will finally be able to play. A shame though, that they can’t use the old map editor.</p>
<p>Time to celebrate with,… Sleep! Something I’m far to familiar with as of late. Ahh, time off is great. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
