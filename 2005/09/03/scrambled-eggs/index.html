  <div class="post-content"><p>A bit of a last minute scramble to get something together for the <a href="http://www.igf.com">IGF</a>. My original idea of getting the new game up and running, hahahaha… erm, sadly no. Progress is good, but not that good. However, I still am sending something. What I’m sending is the old PuffBOMB, from over 2 years ago, with a fresh paint job. The new look finally brings together my style ideas for the game from the past couple years It’s a chance to finally see it in action, and to know, does it suck or not.</p>
<p>This game isn’t finalist material. If I show up in California next year, I don’t deserve to be there. If that happens, I have too many friends. This, it’s only a message. Will we be heard?</p>
<p>Cryptic’s aside, after several years, I decided to dabble in some voice acting. I auditioned and landed a role in a Halo 2 based Machinima series. No, it’s not Red vs. Blue. I beat out 2, maybe 3 other kids and got the part I auditioned for. Not bad for a first try. In a mere hour, I recorded my 14 lines, which is actually all my dialog for the first 3 episodes. Heck, in the first episode I have 3 lines in total, the first 2 being a salute and a confirmation. What can I say, it’s practise. It was fun too.</p>
<p>An old kid like me get’s to learn how to act, and a young one gets to write and be a director. That’s pretty neat.</p>
<p>3 days left. A background and some touchups to go.</p>
