This was a unique month. To start, we actually recieved 11 full versions! Wow. Usually, we get anywhere from 1-3 full versions per month. This time, we had a whopping 11 (1 being freeware).
As for the games… ha ha ha… I’m not telling you. Ok, several interesting ones.

<p>It was an extremely tight month for me to meet, thanks to my busy work shedule. Hopefully, things lighten up soon. Otherwise, I’ll be going crazy. Have a good weekend. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
