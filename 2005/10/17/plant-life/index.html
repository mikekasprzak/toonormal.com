<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to come up with a 3rd character to go along with the hamster and the robot for PuffBOMB. When I started redesigning the game, I wanted at least a male and a female character, but ended up with 2 males (3 if you count a butch hamster that I&rsquo;d recently replaced with the robot).</p>
<p>It seems I have something. What you see to the right is a concept for the potted plant girl character. Yes, a potted plant. Oh, just imagine the hilarious conversations a Hamster, a Robot and a Female Potted Plant could have. Oh the hilarity! Not to mention, the unique dynamics of having a heavier sided character. Does this pot make me look fat?</p>
<p>As we can see, I “for some reason” went with a sort of swooshy shaped head thing, instead of the predictable 4 leaf flower. It&rsquo;s madness I say. This Mike guy is out of control.</p>
<p>The round up should be up on the Tunnel soon. We&rsquo;ve finally gone ahead and begun playing with the layout. Might be some imagry there too.</p>
