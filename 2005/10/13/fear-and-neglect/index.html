Yes, it seems I’ve been neglecting posting. On the plus side, there’s been some major progress, but equally major distractions. Since apparently leaving a job clearly means “2 month vacation”, there I was back at Big Blue for a week. All was good though. I was asked to help a struggling project meet a milestone, and that seemed to go well. Twas also nice to hang out with the guys there again, a fine group I must say.">

<p>Yes, it seems I’ve been neglecting posting. On the plus side, there’s been some major progress, but equally major distractions. Since apparently leaving a job clearly means “2 month vacation”, there I was back at Big Blue for a week. All was good though. I was asked to help a struggling project meet a milestone, and that seemed to go well. Twas also nice to hang out with the guys there again, a fine group I must say.</p>
<p>As for progress, last weekend I hit an internal milestone. In other words, my 2D physics engine is functioning exactly as I wanted it for our dear friend PuffBOMB, and some other little prototype games that may show up. Funky doo!</p>
<p>Excited and shocked by the previous note, I’ve got some round upin’ to finish. Oohh… Trash… Mmmm…</p>
